Description: SourceCodePro fonts
 Source Code was designed by Paul D. Hunt as a companion to
 Source Sans. This complementary family was adapted from the
 Source design due to a request to create a monospaced
 version for coding applications. Source Code preserves the
 design features and vertical proportions of Source Sans, but
 alters the glyph widths so that they are uniform across all
 glyphs and weights.
 .
 Although this family was designed specifically for coding
 environments, for which a regular weight will typically
 suffice, Source Code has been made available in the same
 weight range as the corresponding Source Sans design. Source
 Code Pro currently supports a wide range of languages using
 the Latin script, and includes all the characters in the
 Adobe Latin 4 glyph set.
 .
 As an open source project, it is expected that incremental
 updates will be made over time to extend glyph set coverage
 and functionality. Future releases are expected to add
 support for Greek and Cyrillic scripts, italics, and other
 features documented on the project page at Open@Adobe, which
 is hosted by SourceForge.
 .

 redistributed according to the terms of the Open Font
 License (OFL) agreement.
