Description: AnonymousPro fonts
 Anonymous Pro is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed
 especially with coding in mind. It is inspired by Anonymous
 9, a freeware Macintosh bitmap font developed in the mid-
 '90s by Susan Lesch and David Lamkins, that was intended as
 a more legible alternative to Monaco, the fixed-width
 Macintosh system font.
 .
 Characters that could be mistaken for one another (O, 0, I,
 l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them easier to tell
 apart in the context of source code. The regular and bold
 styles have embedded bitmaps for the smallest sizes (10-13
 ppem.)
