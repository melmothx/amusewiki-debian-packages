Description: CrimsonText fonts
 Crimson Text is a font family for book production in the
 tradition of beautiful oldstyle typefaces.
 .
 There are a lot of great free fonts around, but one kind is
 missing: those Garamond-inspired types with all the little
 niceties like oldstyle figures, small caps, fleurons, math
 characters and the like. In fact, a lot of time is spend
 developing free knock-offs of ugly "standards" like Times
 and Helvetica.
 .
 Crimson Text is inspired by the fantastic work of people
 like Jan Tschichold, Robert Slimbach and Jonathan Hoefler.
 We hope that the free type community will one day be able to
 enjoy Crimson Text as a beautiful workhorse.
