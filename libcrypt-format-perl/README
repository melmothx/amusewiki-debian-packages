NAME
    Crypt::Format - Conversion utilities for encryption applications

SYNOPSIS
        use Crypt::Format;

        my $der = Crypt::Format::pem2der($pem);
        my $pem = Crypt::Format::der2pem($der, 'CERTIFICATE REQUEST');

DESCRIPTION
    Not much more to say! This module is for simple conversions that I got
    tired of writing out.
