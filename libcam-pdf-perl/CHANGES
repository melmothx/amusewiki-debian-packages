1.58  28 May 2012
      Many thanks for Vadim Repin for numerous excellent bug reports!
      [FIXES]
      - Appended pdf revisions incorrectly incremented object generation numbers
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76513
      - Appending pdf revisions was broken for non-linearized PDFs
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76514
      - Allow multiple "startxref" statements in the last 1024 bytes -- unlikely, but possible
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77508
      - Allow whitespace at the beginning of an indirect object (I think the PDF spec is
        ambiguous about this)
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76512
      - Allow backspace character
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76151
      [DOCUMENTATION]
      - mention $pdf->setPageContent($pagenum, $tree->toString());
        Leo Lapworth and http://cpanforum.com/posts/13228

1.57  17 Dec 2011
      [FIXES]
      - Test for undef streams instead of truth, to allow streams like '' or '0'
        Thanks to Thorsten Schwander for the patch
      - Failed to parse PDF 1.5 cross reference streams where a
        1024-byte boundary happened to fall between "endstream" and
        "endobj" do to a logic error.
        Thanks to Thorsten Schwander for the report and fix suggestion

1.56  13 Dec 2011
      [FIXES]
      - Workaround for corrupt PDFs that have 'n' records in their index that point to byte zero
        of the file. Silently treat those as 'f' records. Yet another case of Acrobat supporting
        broken PDFs, so the rest of us have to support them too...
        Thanks to Mark Hunnibell for a sample PDF that demonstrated the problem

1.55  22 Jun 2011
      [FIXES]
      - Performance enhancement saving large files
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69021
        Thanks to David Porter of Audacitas Limited for the patch

1.54  26 Mar 2011
      [FIXES]
      - appendPDF was broken intermittently if appended doc was bigger than main doc
        Thanks to Charlie Katz for a sample PDF
        http://chrisdolan.net/talk/2011/03/26/cam-pdf-fixes-appendpdf-bug/

1.53  25 Mar 2011
      [FIXES]
      - Handle PDF 1.5 case where "endstream" token crosses a 1024-byte boundary
        Thanks to Charlie Katz for a sample PDF
      - Allow whitespace after the 'stream' token for better interoperability
        http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=42819
        Credit to Vonne 'Robert' Bannavong

      - Tolerate leading zeros on objnums and gennums
        http://www.cpanforum.com/posts/11494

1.52  02 Oct 2008
      [FIXES]
      - Better handling of failures during filter loading
        (rlane10 via http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/10/msg2361238.html)

1.51  28 Sep 2008
      [FIXES]
      - Support PDFs with 24-bit offsets in the xref stream (PDF v1.5 only)

1.50  20 Sep 2008
      [ENHANCEMENTS]
      - Support for reading PDF 1.5 compressed object streams and cross reference streams.
        (we cannot write this style, but we can append to it)
      [FIXES]
      - Decompression of PNG-filtered streams was totally broken.
      - Deleting pages now also deletes back references from annotations on that page.
      - cleanse() now removes PieceInfo data.  I have no idea what
        PieceInfo does, but it had a whole bunch of page back links
        that broke page deletion.

1.21  13 Aug 2008
      [FIXES]
      - Permit comments after the %%EOF, like Adobe Reader does.  Thanks to
        Malcolm Cook for pointing out the incompatibility.

1.20  26 Jun 2008
      [ENHANCEMENTS]
      - Support for Type 2 encryption (just reading, not writing)
      - Support for reading PDFs where the owner and user passwords
        are different
      - Improvement to performance of node traversal, inspired by
        RT #35555 (credit Eric Hall and his anonymous employee).

1.13  23 Apr 2008

        Andrew Cadman for finding the bug and suggesting a fix

1.12  27 Nov 2007
      [FIXES]
      - I just realized that CAM::PDF::Renderer::Text was useless
        because it just printed to STDOUT.  Fixed to offer a
        toString() method instead.  Fuse::PDF wants this feature.
      - Fixed a typo in the Synopsis of CAM::PDF::Content

1.11  20 Nov 2007

        This is a case where the delete code does a poor job of
        maintaining a balanced page tree and then complains about it's
        own bad work.  This should eventually be fixed, but for now,
        removing the die() is good enough.
