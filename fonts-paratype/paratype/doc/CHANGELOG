----------

- Added OT2 encoding. Now, you can write some cyrillic text
	using the Latin transcription.

2013-05-21
----------

- Added PT Mono Bold in the Type 1 format provided by ParaType.
	Now, all the fonts are in both the TrueType and Type 1
	format.

- Removed paratype-mixed.map. There is no need to mix TrueType
	and Type 1 fonts.


2013-05-19
----------

- Added PT Mono Regular in the Type 1 format provided by ParaType.
	PT Mono Bold in the Type 1 format is still missing.

- Changed paratype-type1.map and paratype-mixed.map to use the
	PT Mono Regular in the Type 1 format.


2013-04-01
----------

- Added faked (bold) slanted style where there is no true (bold) italic
	style. That means that these styles were added for families
	PT Sans Caption, PT Sans Narrow and PT Mono. There is no automatic
	substitution from the italic style to the faked slanted style.


2012-06-03
----------

- Added PT Mono Bold, updated PT Mono Regular.


2012-02-24
----------

- The files with the license of fonts in English and Russian contained
	spaces in the file names (these were original file names).
	Replaced spaces by underscores in these file names. Pointed out
	by Karl Berry.


2012-02-22
----------

- Added font PT Mono (currently just TrueType format).

- My converted Type 1 version of fonts PT Sans and PT Serif is replaced
	by Type 1 fonts kindly provided by ParaType. It has two important
	advantages: First, they are of much higher quality. Second,
	the distribution of the fonts is not limited to TeX.

- Added map file paratype-mixed.map that sets Type 1 version of PT Sans
	and PT Serif and TrueType version of PT Mono. It is just temporary
	sollution before I get Type 1 version of PT Mono. This map file
	may disappear in future releases of this package.

- Added support for faked styles UprightItalic and Slanted of PT Serif.
	Requested by A. Jan Kutylowski. There are no font files containing
	these styles, the styles are generated on the fly. There is small
	incompatibility: In the previous version of paratype, if you
	requested slanted shape of PT Serif, it was replaced by italic
	shape. Now, there is both italic and slanted shape and they are
	different.

- Removed f-ligatures from the TS1 and X2 encodings. They were set explicitely
	for all encodings on the command line, no matter if they were really
	needed.

- The file paratype.sty sets PTMono-TLF as the default monospaced font.


2011-05-09
----------

- This package was created by merging packages ptsans and ptserif.
	It was suggested by Karl Berry, because I was updating both
	packages at the same time and there were similar changes. The
	fonts are designed to be used together and the maintenance
	of one package will be easier. LaTeX sources that worked with
	package ptsans or ptserif should also work with package
	paratype without any changes.

- The font activated by package PTSans can use also condensed and bold
	condensed series now.

- Removed unusable substitutions (like bx/sl --> b/it) in the font
	definition files for PTSansNarrow, PTSansCaption and PTSerifCaption.
	It was caused by my script that applied patch with these
	substitutions for PTSans/T1 also to all other *.fd files. I simply
	forgot to take into account that there are only two narrow and
	two caption styles.

- Added file paratype.sty that sets PTSans-TLF as the sans serif
	family and PTSerif-TLF as the serif family.
