Description: Read Perlâ€™s symbol table programmatically
 Occasionally I have need to reference a variable programmatically.
 Symbol::Get facilitates that by providing an easy, syntactic-sugar-y,
 read-only interface to the symbol table.
 .
 The SYNOPSIS above should pretty well cover usage.
 .
 This description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
