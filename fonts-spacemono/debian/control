Description: SpaceMono fonts
 Space Mono is an original fixed-width type family designed
 by Colophon Foundry for Google Design. It supports a Latin
 Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and
 other Western European languages.
 .
 Developed for editorial use in headline and display
 typography, the letterforms infuse a geometric foundation
 and grotesque details with qualities often found in headline
 typefaces of the 1960s (See: Microgramma, Eurostile), many
 of which have since been co-opted by science fiction films,
 television, and literature.
 .
 Typographic features include old-style figures, superscript
 and subscript numerals, fractions, center-height and cap-
 height currency symbols, directional arrows, and multiple
 stylistic alternates.
 .
 Colophon Foundry is a London and Los Angeles-based digital
 type foundry established in 2009. Its members comprise
 Benjamin Critton (US), Edd Harrington (UK), and Anthony
 Sheret (UK). The foundry's commissioned work in type design
 is complemented by work in editorial design, publishing,
 curation, and pedagogy. Visit colophon-foundry.org
