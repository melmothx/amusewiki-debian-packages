shortdesc David Carlisle's small packages
longdesc Many of David Carlisle's more substantial packages stand on
longdesc their own, or as part of the LaTeX latex-tools set; this set
longdesc contains: Making dotless 'j' characters for fonts that don't
longdesc have them; A method for combining the capabilities of longtable
longdesc and tabularx; An environment for including Plain TeX in LaTeX
longdesc documents; A jiffy to remove counters from other counters'
longdesc reset lists (now obsolete as it has been incorporated into the
longdesc LaTeX format); A jiffy to create 'slashed' characters for
longdesc physicists.
