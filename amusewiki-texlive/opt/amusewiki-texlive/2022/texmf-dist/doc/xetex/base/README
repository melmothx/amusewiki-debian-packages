XeTeX is an extension of Donald Knuth's TeX, originally and primarily
written by Jonathan Kew.  It natively supports UTF-8 Unicode input and
TrueType and OpenType fonts, mainly via external third-party libraries.
(Run xetex --version to see a list of the principal ones.)

XeTeX's user-level output is a PDF file; it does not support standard
DVI output.
