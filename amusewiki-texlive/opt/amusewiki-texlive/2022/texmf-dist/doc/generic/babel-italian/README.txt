Description
This file contain the necessary and supplementary data for typesetting documents in Italian with babel as the language manager.
It defines the infix words, the date in various formats. Optionally lets the user activate a number of shorthands to perform routine frequent tasks by means of the active character " that can be freely activated and deactivated. 
It defines an intelligent mathematical comma that recognises if it has to perform as a punctuation mark or as a decimal separator. Another user command activates or deactivates some commands to supply a minimum of the performance that is fully provided by the siunitx package. The file allows using babel also when a document is typeset with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX, even if, according to the author, polyglossia is preferred when typesetting documents in Italian, in spite of the fact that gloss-italian.ldf for polyglossia provides less facilities than the ones available with babel.

The documentation that is provided by running LaTeX on the italian.dtx file provides full documentation of every facility provided by the italian.ldf file.

The documentation contains the licence clauses.
