# babel-japanese

The package "babel-japanese" (or shortly, "japanese" package) provides
`japanese` option for Babel package. It defines all the language
definition macros in Japanese.


## Limitations

Note that this package is not perfect: the word order in Japanese is
different from that in most Western languages including English, so
the words like "Part" or "Chapter" cannot be replaced with Japanese
counterpart. This limitation is due to the design of classes.dtx
(article.cls etc), which has \chaptername in front of the numbering
but no sequence behind the number.

The common Japanese classes including (u)jclasses in (u)pLaTeX,
jsclasses, ltj(s)classes in LuaTeX-ja are well-supported.


## Installation

1) Process babel-japanese.ins with some tex engine.
   For example, using lualatex:

        lualatex babel-japanese.ins

   When you use platex, give -kanji=utf8 option.

        platex -kanji=utf8 babel-japanese.ins

   You will get japanese.ldf (the main code) and
   babel-japanese-sample.tex (sample document for pLaTeX).

2) Process documentation, babel-japanese.dtx and
   babel-japanese-sample.tex, as you wish.
   babel-japanese.dtx can be processed with pLaTeX, upLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
   babel-japanese-sample.tex is written for pLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.

   If you use lualatex:

        lualatex babel-japanese.dtx
        lualatex babel-japanese-sample.tex

   If you use platex:

        platex -kanji=utf8 babel-japanese.dtx
        dvipdfmx babel-japanese.dvi
        platex -kanji=utf8 babel-japanese-sample.tex
        dvipdfmx babel-japanese-sample.dvi

3) Deploy the directory or files in an appropriate place under
   the TEXMF tree.

        * japanese.ldf
               => $TEXMF/tex/generic/babel-japanese/
        * babel-japanese.dtx
               => $TEXMF/source/generic/babel-japanese/
        * babel-japanese-sample.tex, japanese.tex and PDF files
               => $TEXMF/doc/generic/babel-japanese/

4) Execute mktexlsr.
