ABOUT

The everyhook package takes control of the six TeX token parameters
everypar, everymath, everydisplay, everyhbox, everyvbox, and everycr.
Real hooks for each of these can be installed using a stack like
interface. For compatibility with LaTeX standard classes and packages,
each of the everyX token lists can be set without interfering with the
hooks.
