\ProvidesFile{gloss-portuges.ldf}[polyglossia: module for Portuguese]

% We only provide this gloss for backwards compatibility. The name
% 'portuges' was selected in accordance with babel (which probably
% introduced it in 8.3 filename times). Since polyglossia uses full
% English language names, we use 'portuguese' now.
