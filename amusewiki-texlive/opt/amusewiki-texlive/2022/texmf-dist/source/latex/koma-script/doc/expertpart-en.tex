  \noindent In this part, you can find information for the authors of LaTeX
  packages and classes. This applies not only to commands that are useful for
  implementing new packages and classes, but also to interfaces that allow
  further alteration of \KOMAScript{}. Moreover, this part provides
  information on obsolete options and instructions, as well as background
  information on the implementation of \KOMAScript{}.

  This part is intended to supplement the information for authors of articles,
  reports, books and letters in \autoref{part:forAuthors}. More information
  and examples for those users can be found in that part.
