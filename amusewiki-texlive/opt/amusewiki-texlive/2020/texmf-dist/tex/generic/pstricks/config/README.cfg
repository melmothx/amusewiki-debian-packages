This directory contains the special PSTricks config files for
the different platforms. By default the dvips config file is
already in your current TeX distribution as pstricks.con.
If you use another platform then you have to replace the current
pstricks.con by one of the following cfg files:

- PostScript header files

-- If you use the Y&Y's "dvipsone" DVI to PostScript converter,
you have to rename config.cfg to generic/pstricks.con and to move
all the files of the "dvips" subdirectory to the TeX input folder.

-- If you use the MicroPress "VTeX" DVI to PostScript converter,
you have to rename config/vtex.cfg to generic/pstricks.con and to move
all the files of the "dvips" subdirectory to the TeX input folder.

-- If you use XeTeX, you have to rename config/xdvipdfmx.cfg to 
   generic/pstricks.con

-- If you use the "textures" (version 1.7/1.8 or 2.0) DVI to PostScript
   converter (for Macintosh), you should proceed as follows:
          * create a new folder PSTricks (for instance) as a subfolder in
            Textures' TeX inputs folder,
          * copy the "generic", "dvips", "latex" and "contrib" subfolders
            from the "pstricks" folder to the newly created "PSTricks" folder,
          * open the "generic" folder and remove the file pstricks.con,
            then rename the file textures.cfg to pstricks.con,
          * open the "dvips" folder and change the following line in the file
            pstricks.pro (courtesy Michael J. Sharpe <msharpe@euclid.ucsd.edu>):
            /STV { SDict begin normalscale end STP  } def
            by
            /STV { Mag 72.27 72 div mul dup neg scale STP  } def
            It was also reported that the `pst-text' package (to put text
            along paths) doesn't work with the "textures" driver.
            Textures's users must also look at the page kindly maintained
            by Michael Sharpe: http://math.ucsd.edu/~msharpe/pst-textures.html

-- If you use another driver than these four ones, you have to adapt
a pstricks.con file for it, if the one for "dvips" doesn't work for it.
You can also look at the instructions of the old obsolete/src/pstricks.con
file. And if nothing work, ask for help on the PSTricks mailing list,
hopping that somebody on the list has the same configuration than you ...
