DESCRIPTION:

This directory contains the documented sources of the `mflogo'
package for LaTeX(2e) and the corresponding font definition files
that provide access to the METAFONT and METAPOST `logo' fonts.

The `mflogo' package defines the font commands |\logofamily| and
|\textlogo| to access the `logo' fonts directly.  It also defines
the macros |\MF| and |\MP| for the METAFONT and METAPOST logos in
terms of these font commands, which ensures that the logos will
follow font changes just as the |\TeX| logo does and always did.

To use this package, you'll need the complete and up-to-date set
of `logo' fonts, located in the directory CTAN:fonts/mflogo.

To facilitate the installation, the directory containing the
`logo' fonts is made available through a symbolic link `fonts',
so that the contents of CTAN:fonts/mflogo is automatically
included as a subdirectory if you download this directory as a
`.zip' or `.tar.gz' archive.


HISTORY:

The `mflogo' package was developed in early 1994 when LaTeX2e was
still in a beta-test phase.  The first public release of `mflogo'
(v1.2 in May 1994) predated the release of the first production
version of LaTeX as of 1994/06/01.

The second release of `mflogo' (v1.5 in September 1995) cleaned up
some internals and fixed the space factor after the logos, just as
it is done for the |\TeX| and |\LaTeX| logos in the LaTeX kernel.

The present release of `mflogo' (v2.0 in March 1999) clarifies the
distribution conditions, adopting the LaTeX Project Public License.


OVERVIEW:

The `mflogo' distribution consists of the following files:

  README        - this file, i.e. the file you are reading
  Makefile      - Makefile to install the LaTeX package
  mflogo.ins    - LaTeX installation script
  mflogo.dtx    - documented source of the LaTeX package

Subdirectory `fonts':

  README        - some notes on the `logo' fonts
  Makefile      - Makefile to install the `logo' fonts

Subdirectory `fonts/source':

  logo.mf       - Metafont program to draw the logo charaters
  logo*.mf      - Metafont drivers for various sizes and shapes

Subdirectory `fonts/tfm':

  logo*.tfm     - TeX font metrics for various sizes and shapes


INSTALLATION:

(1) Before installing the `mflogo' LaTeX package and processing
the documentation, you should first make sure that you have a
complete and up-to-date set of the `logo' fonts.  If you're
lucky, the `logo' fonts may have already been provided as part 
of your TeX distribution.  Otherwise, proceed by changing to the
`fonts' subdirectory and installing the fonts from there.

if you have a TDS-compatible TeX installation, you may try to use
the enclosed `Makefile' in the `fonts' subdirectory by calling

  cd fonts ; make install TEXMF=/wherever/texmf

For manual installation of the font sources and font metric files,
please consult the file `fonts/README'.

(2) After the required fonts have been installed, return to this
distribution directory.  To unpack the `mflogo' LaTeX package
and to typeset the documentation, proceed as follows:

If you have a TDS-compatible TeX installation, you may try to use
the enclosed `Makefile' by calling

  make TEXMF=/wherever/texmf
  make install TEXMF=/wherever/texmf

For manual installation, run

  latex mflogo.ins

to unpack the package file `mflogo.sty' and the corresponding
font definition files `ulogo.fd' from the source file `mflogo.dtx'.

To typeset the documentation, run

  (pdf)latex mflogo.dtx

to generate `mflogo.dvi' and/or `mflogo.pdf'.  This requires
the `mflogo' and, of course, the `logo' fonts.

Finally, to install the `mflogo' package, copy the files
`mflogo.sty' and `ulogo.fd' to TEXMF/tex/latex/mflogo/ or
wherever else your installation keeps LaTeX `.sty' files.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

The `mflogo' package boldly assumes that your TeX distribution
provides a complete and up-to-date version of the `logo' fonts,
including some non-standard variants and some extra characters
that were absent from earlier (pre-1993) versions.

While it should no problem to regenerate PK-bitmap fonts from
the updated Metafont sources, if necessary, some problems may
arise when using PostScript Type 1 versions of the `logo' fonts.

Unless you happen to have access to some commercial versions of
the up-to-date `logo' fonts in Type 1 format as sold by Y&Y Inc.,
it is highly recommended to use the freely-distributable versions
by Taco Hoekwater, which are available from CTAN archives in:

  CTAN:fonts/cm/utilityfonts/logo/ps-type1/hoekwater/logo*.pfb

It is no longer recommended to use the freely-distributable
versions of `logo' fonts provided by the American Mathematical
Society, which are available from CTAN archives in:

  CTAN:fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky/logo*.pfb

Unfortunately, those fonts are out-of-date and do not provide a
complete set of sizes and shapes required by `mflogo' package.


Happy TeXing!
