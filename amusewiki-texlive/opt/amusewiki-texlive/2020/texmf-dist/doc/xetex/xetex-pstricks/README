PSTricks configuration for XeTeX (with the xdvipdfmx driver)
============================================================

This package provides configuration files to support the use of PSTricks
with the xdvipdfmx output driver, required by the XeTeX engine.

To enable the xetex and xelatex formats to find the correct configuration,
without interfering with other programs (e.g, LaTeX + dvips), two files
named `pstricks.con' are installed as:
  tex/xetex/xetex-pstricks/pstricks.con
  tex/xelatex/xetex-pstricks/pstricks.con
These will be found by default when PSTricks is loaded by Xe(La)TeX, but not
by other engines which will find the standard `pstricks.con' file in the
`generic' tree.

These two files simply load the real configuration file `xdvipdfmx.con' from
the main pstricks package. This allows PSTricks to work automatically with
XeTeX, without requiring the user to add options to the source or to copy or
rename configuration files.
