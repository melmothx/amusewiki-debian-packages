This file documents changes to the ec and tc fonts after 1-FEB-1997

 5-JAN-2012 Removed the condition that the original files have to
            be distributed together with derived changed files
            from the licence in copyrite.txt (On request from the Free
            Software Foundation)

 5-JAN-2012 On this occasion, I updated my address in copyrite.txt
            All my old e-mail addresses are invalid now. A current
            one is jknappen@web.de

 1-FEB-1997 Opened this file. Made minor corrections to the readme files.
            Note the new e-mail adress:   joerg.knappen@uni-mainz.de
            The old one will remain valid for some time.
