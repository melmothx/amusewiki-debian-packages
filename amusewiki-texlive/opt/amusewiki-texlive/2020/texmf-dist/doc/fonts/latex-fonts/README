This is a bundle of miscellaneous fonts, provided (as MetaFont source
and as TeX font metrics) for users of LaTeX.

Additional fonts, which used to be distributed here, are now part of
the amsfonts distribution -- see directory CTAN:/fonts/amsfonts

The amsfonts distribution also contains Adobe Type 1 versions of the
fonts in this distribution.
