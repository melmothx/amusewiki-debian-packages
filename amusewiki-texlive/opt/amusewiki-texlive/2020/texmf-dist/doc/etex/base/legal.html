<H1>The legal status of e-T<sub><big>E</big></sub>X </H1>
When <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Professor Donald
E.&nbsp;Knuth</A> released TeX to the world, he did so in a simple and
straightforward way which allowed users everywhere to benefit from his work
whilst protecting them from pirated and illegal versions.  He did so without
pages of legalese, using simple language and in terms that are readily
understood <p> 
In creating e-TeX, we have followed his example: we 
release
e-TeX to the world under exactly the same conditions as Don
released TeX.  The name e-TeX is a trademark of the 
<a href="nts-group.html">NTS group</a>,
as are its typeset and HTML logos.  No package may describe
itself as "e-TeX" unless (a)&nbsp;it is generated using the official
source files from the e-TeX reference site, together with such
system-dependent changes as are necessary and permitted in order
for it to run on a specific system, and (b)&nbsp;it has been validated
for conformity using the <a href="etrip.zip">e-TRIP</a> test.
<p>
No changes shall be made by anyone other than a member of the
NTS group to any of the files which form a part of the e-TeX
distribution.  If, for whatever reason, someone other than
a member of the NTS group wishes to change such a file, then
he or she shall (a) add a comment indicating the reason for,
and nature of the change, together with the date and the name
of the person making the change, and (b) shall save the changed
file under a different name, so that there shall exist no
risk of confusion between the changed file and the authoritative
official version.
<p>
Although it is <em>preferred</em> that e-TeX be distributed in
source form, it is recognised that there are systems for which
binary distributions are the norm.  It is therefore
<em>required</em> that any binary distribution of e-TeX be
accompanied by a clear statement that the definitive sources
for e-TeX are available free-of-charge at the
<a href="http://www.rhbnc.ac.uk/e-TeX/">e-TeX reference site</a>.
<p>
With the exception of anything specifically referred to above,
all components of the system known as "e-TeX" are
released under exactly the same terms and conditions as the
system known as "TeX".
<p>
Enjoy!
