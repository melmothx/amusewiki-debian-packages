The xunicode package.

The package provides access to latin accents and many other characters
in the Unicode lower plane.

This package is designed to work with TeX engines that directly
process UTF8 input and use Unicode and OpenType fonts.
At the time of writing, XeTeX is the only known engine of this kind.

(When other engines become available, the package will need modifying
not to check solely for XeTeX.)
