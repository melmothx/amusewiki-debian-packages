shortdesc Package for underlining
longdesc The package provides an \ul (underline) command which will
longdesc break over line ends; this technique may be used to replace \em
longdesc (both in that form and as the \emph command), so as to make
longdesc output look as if it comes from a typewriter. The package also
longdesc offers double and wavy underlining, and striking out (line
longdesc through words) and crossing out (/// over words). The package
longdesc works with both Plain TeX and LaTeX.
