From version 3.10 to 3.38, the package
\href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/scrwfile}{\Package{scrwfile}} was part of
\KOMAScript. After that, it was separated from \KOMAScript{} as a standalone
package. This seemed and still seems reasonable because the package was always
experimental and without official support. Moreover, for some time now the
recommendation has been to use \LuaLaTeX{} instead, since with \LuaLaTeX{} the
basic problem:
\begin{lstoutput}
  ! No room for a new \write .
  \ch@ck ...\else \errmessage {No room for a new #3}
                                                    \fi 
\end{lstoutput}
no longer exists.

If you have been using the package and still need it, you can install install
it separately. Preferably use the package manager of your \TeX{}
distribution. More information about the package can be found in the CTAN
catalog entry \cite{package:scrwfile}.%
