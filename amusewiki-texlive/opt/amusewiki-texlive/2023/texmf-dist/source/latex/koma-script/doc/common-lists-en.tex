  The information in \autoref{sec:\ThisCommonFirstLabelBase.lists} applies
  equally to this chapter. So if you have already read and understood
  \autoref{sec:\ThisCommonFirstLabelBase.lists}, you can skip ahead to

      The \Package{scrletter}\OnlyAt{\Package{scrletter}} package does not
      define any list environments itself but leaves them to the class
      used. If this is not a \KOMAScript{} class, it will load
      \hyperref[cha:scrextend]{\Package{scrextend}}\IndexPackage{scrextend}%
      \important{\hyperref[cha:scrextend]{\Package{scrextend}}}. %
    }{}%
    However, the \Package{scrextend} package only defines the
    \DescRef{\ThisCommonLabelBase.env.labeling},
    \DescRef{\ThisCommonLabelBase.env.addmargin}, and
    \DescRef{\ThisCommonLabelBase.env.addmargin*} environments. All other list

  Both {\LaTeX} and the standard classes\textnote{\KOMAScript{} vs. standard
    classes} offer different environments for lists. Naturally, {\KOMAScript}
  also offers all these environments, though slightly modified or extended in
  some cases. In general, all lists\,---\,even those of different
  kinds\,---\,can be nested up to four levels deep. From a typographical view,
  anything more would make no sense, as lists of more than three levels cannot
  easily be apprehended. In such cases, I recommend\textnote{Hint!} that you
  split a large list into several smaller ones.%

\IfThisCommonFirstRun{}{%
  Because lists are standard elements of \LaTeX{}, examples have been omitted
  in this section. Nevertheless, you can find examples either in
  \autoref{sec:\ThisCommonFirstLabelBase.lists},

  The simplest form of a list is the itemized list\textnote{itemized list},
  \Environment{itemize}. %
  \iffalse % Umbruckoptimierungstext
  The users of a certain disliked word processing package often refer to this
  form of a list as \emph{bullet points}. Presumably, they cannot imagine
  that, depending on the level, a symbol other than a large dot could be used
  to introduce each point. %
  \fi%
  Depending on the level, \KOMAScript{} classes use the following marks:
  ``{\labelitemi}'', ``{\labelitemii}'', ``{\labelitemiii}'', and
  ``{\labelitemiv}''. The definition of these symbols is specified in the
  macros \Macro{labelitemi}, \Macro{labelitemii}, \Macro{labelitemiii}, and
  \Macro{labelitemiv}, all of which you can redefine using
  \Macro{renewcommand}.

  \FontElement{labelitemiv}\important{\FontElement{labelitemiv}}. By default
  these all use the font setting for element
  \FontElement{itemizelabel}\important{\FontElement{itemizelabel}}. Only
  element \FontElement{labelitemii} additionally uses \Macro{bfseries}. The
  default of \FontElement{itemizelabel} itself is \Macro{normalfont}.  Every
  item is introduced with \Macro{item}.%

    \begin{Example}
      \phantomsection\xmpllabel{env.itemize}%
      You have a simple list which is nested in several levels. You write,
      for example:
\begin{lstcode}
  \minisec{Vehicles in the game}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item aeroplanes
    \begin{itemize}
      \item biplane
      \item transport planes
      \begin{itemize}
        \item single-engine
        \begin{itemize}
          \item jet propelled
          \item propeller driven
        \end{itemize}
        \item twin-engine
        \begin{itemize}
	      \item jet propelled
		  \item propeller driven
		\end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
      \item helicopters
    \end{itemize}
    \item motorcycles
    \item automobiles
    \begin{itemize}
      \item racing cars
      \item passenger cars
      \item lorries
    \end{itemize}
    \item bicycles
  \end{itemize}

      As output you get:

  \IfThisCommonLabelBase{scrlttr2}{\OnlyAt{\Class{scrlttr2}}}{}The numbered
  list\textnote{numbered list} is also very common and already provided by the
  {\LaTeX} kernel. The numbering\Index{numbering} differs according to the
  level, with Arabic numbers, small letters, small Roman numerals, and capital
  letters, respectively. The style of numbering is defined with the macros
  \Macro{theenumi} down to \Macro{theenumiv}. The output format is determined
  by the macros \Macro{labelenumi} to \Macro{labelenumiv}. While the small
  letter of the second level is followed by a right parenthesis, the values of
  all other levels are followed by a dot. Every item is introduced with
  \Macro{item}.%
  \IfThisCommonFirstRun{\iftrue}{\csname iffalse\endcsname}
    \begin{Example}
      \phantomsection\xmpllabel{env.enumerate}%
      Let's shorten the previous example, using an 
      \DescRef{\ThisCommonLabelBase.env.itemize} environment instead of the
      \Environment{enumerate} environment:
      \begin{ShowOutput}[\baselineskip]
        \minisec{Vehicles in the game}
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item aeroplanes
          \begin{enumerate}

              \begin{enumerate}
              \item jet-propelled\label{xmp:maincls.jets}
              \item propeller-driven
              \end{enumerate}
            \item twin-engine
            \end{enumerate}
          % \item helicopters

        %  \begin{enumerate}
        %  \item racing cars
        %  \item private cars
        %  \item lorries
        %  \end{enumerate}
        %\item bicycles
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{ShowOutput}
      Within the list, you can set labels in the normal way with 
      \Macro{label} and then reference then with \Macro{ref}.
      In the example above, a label was set after the jet-propelled,
      single-engine transport planes with
      ``\Macro{label}\PParameter{xmp:jets}''. The \Macro{ref} value is then
      ``\ref{xmp:maincls.jets}''.

    \begin{Example}
      \phantomsection\xmpllabel{env.description}%
      You want the keywords to be printed bold and in the normal font instead 
      of bold and sans serif. Using
\begin{lstcode}
  \setkomafont{descriptionlabel}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\end{lstcode}
      you redefine the font accordingly.

      An example for a description list is the output of the page styles
      listed in \autoref{sec:maincls.pagestyle}. The (abbreviated) source is:
\begin{lstcode}
  \begin{description}
    \item[empty] is the page style without any header or footer.
    \item[plain] is the page style without headings.
    \item[headings] is the page style with running headings.
    \item[myheadings] is the page style for manual headings.
  \end{description}
\end{lstcode}
      This gives:
      \begin{ShowOutput}
        \begin{description}
        \item[empty] is the page style without any header or footer.
        \item[plain] is the page style without headings.

    As this example shows, you can set a font-changing command in the usual
    way. But if you do not want the font of the separator to be changed in the
    same way as the font of the label, you have to set the font of the
    separator as well.

Originally, this environment was implemented for things like ``Premise,
Evidence, Proof'', or ``Given, Find, Solution'' that are often used in
lecture handouts.  These days, however, the environment has very different
applications. For example, the environment for examples in this guide was
defined with the \Environment{labeling} environment.%

  \IfThisCommonLabelBase{scrlttr2}{\OnlyAt{\Class{scrlttr2}}}{} The
  \Environment{verse} environment\textnote{verse} is not normally perceived
  as a list environment because you do not work with \Macro{item} commands.
  Instead, fixed line breaks are used within the \Environment{flushleft}

  {\KOMAScript} implement it as a list environment.

  In general, the \Environment{verse} environment is used for
  poetry\Index{poetry}.  Lines are indented both left and right. Individual
  lines of verse are ended by a fixed line break: \verb|\\|. Verses are set as
  paragraphs, separated by an empty line. Often also
  \Macro{medskip}\IndexCmd{medskip} or \Macro{bigskip}\IndexCmd{bigskip} is
  used instead. To avoid a page break at the end of a line of verse you can,
  as usual, insert \verb|\\*| instead of \verb|\\|.

      However, if you have very long lines of verse where a line 
      break occurs within a line of verse:
\begin{lstcode}
  \begin{verse}
    Both the philosopher and the house-owner
    always have something to repair.\\*
    \bigskip
    Don't trust a man, my son, who tells you

          lied.

      \end{ShowOutput}
      in this case \verb|\\*| can not prevent a page break occurring within a
      verse at such a line break. To prevent such a page break, a change of
      \Macro{interlinepenalty}\IndexCmd{interlinepenalty} would have to be
      inserted at the beginning of the environment:
\begin{lstcode}
  \begin{verse}\interlinepenalty 10000

    always have something to repair.\\
    \bigskip

        Here are two sayings that should always be considered when confronted
        with seemingly strange questions about {\LaTeX} or its accompanying
        explanations:
\begin{lstcode}
  \begin{verse}
    A little learning is a dangerous thing.\\*
    Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring;\\

          \end{verse}

      Incidentally, \Macro{bigskip} was used in these examples to separate two
      sayings.

    The old year was turning brown; the West Wind was

Like \IfThisCommonLabelBase{scrextend}{%

  the standard and the \KOMAScript{} classes}{%
  \DescRef{\ThisCommonLabelBase.env.quote} and
  \DescRef{\ThisCommonLabelBase.env.quotation}%
}, the \Environment{addmargin} environment changes the margin\Index{margin}.
However, unlike the first two environments, \Environment{addmargin} lets the
user change the width of the indentation. Apart from this change, this
environment does not change the indentation of the first line nor the vertical
spacing between paragraphs.

If only the obligatory argument \PName{indentation} is given, both the left
and right margin are expanded by this value. If the optional argument
\PName{left indentation} is given as well, then the value \PName{left
  indentation} is used for the left margin instead of \PName{indentation}.

The starred variant \Environment{addmargin*}%
\important{\Environment{addmargin*}} differs from the normal version only in
the two-sided mode. Furthermore, the difference only occurs if the optional
argument \PName{inner indentation} is used. In this case, the value of
\PName{inner indentation} is added to the normal inner indentation. For
right-hand pages this is the left margin; for left-hand pages, the right
margin. Then the value of \PName{indentation} determines the width of the
opposite margin.

Both versions of this environment allow negative values for all parameters.

  }{%
      \rule[.25\baselineskip]{\linewidth}{2pt}%
      \end{minipage}%

    If you now put your source code in such an environment, it will show
    up as:

          \end{minipage}%
        \end{addmargin*}%
      }
      You define the following environment:
      \begin{SourceCodeFrame}
\begin{lstcode}
\newenvironment{\SourceCodeFrame}{%
  \begin{addmargin*}[1em]{-1em}%
    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}%
      \rule{\linewidth}{2pt}%
}{%
    \rule[.25\baselineskip]{\linewidth}{2pt}%
    \end{minipage}%
  \end{addmargin*}%
}
\end{lstcode}
      \end{SourceCodeFrame}
      This may be feasible or not. In any case, it shows the usage of this
      environment.
    \end{ShowOutput}
    The optional argument of the \Environment{addmargin*} environment
    makes sure that the inner margin is extended by 1\Unit{em}. In turn
    the outer margin is decreased by 1\Unit{em}. The result is a shift
    by 1\Unit{em} to the outside.  Instead of \PValue{1em}, you can of
    course use a length, for example, \PValue{2\Macro{parindent}}.
