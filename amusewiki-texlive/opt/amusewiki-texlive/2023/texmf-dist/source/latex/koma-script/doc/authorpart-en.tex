  \noindent This part provides information for writers of articles, reports,
  books, and letters. The average user is probably less interested in how
  things are implemented in \KOMAScript{} and what pitfalls exist. Also,
  normal users aren't interested in obsolete options and instructions. They
  want to know how to achieve things using current options and instructions,
  and perhaps in some background information about typography.

  The few passages in this part which contain extra information and
  explanations that may be of less interest for the impatient reader are set
  in a sans-serif typeface and can be skipped if desired. For those who are
  interested in more information about the implementation, side-effects with
  other packages, or obsolete options and instructions, please refer to
  \autoref{part:forExperts} beginning on \autopageref{part:forExperts}. That
  part of the \KOMAScript{} guide also describes all the features that were
  created specially for authors of packages and classes.%
