This is the README file of the mincho-1-8-20080306.tar.gz package.

The original font file is

  ftp://ftp.ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Font/wadalab-mincho-1-8.tar.Z

which can be also found at CTAN as

  support/ghostscript/3rdparty/fonts/kanji/Font/wadalab-mincho-1-8.tar.gz

It has been first converted with a patched version of the program `wftodm',
then with the scripts `makefont' (version 1.0) and `fixwada2.pl' to produce
a set of PFB, AFM, and TFM subfont files in DNP font encoding which can be
used with the CJK package for LaTeX.

This font package follows the TDS directory structure; the font family name
for DNP font encoding is `mc2j'. You can find virtual fonts in Unicode font
encoding which use mincho-1-8 in the mincho-0-8-20080306.tar.gz and
mincho-0-12-20080306.tar.gz packages.

Please read the documentation file `contrib/wadalab/DNP.doc' of the CJK
package for further details on installation and usage; there you can also
find a proper font mapping file and font definition files for use with
LaTeX.
