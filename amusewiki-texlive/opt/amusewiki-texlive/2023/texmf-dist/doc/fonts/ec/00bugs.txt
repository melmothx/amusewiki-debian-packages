% List of `known' bugs in the ec-fonts version 1.0 as of 19-JAN-1997


This file contains the known bugs in version 1.0 of the ec-fonts. The bugs 
are given in no particular order. If you think you have found a bug in ec 
fonts 1.0, please check this list, if it is already `known'.

 1. With the following input files, some low resolution errors 
    occur frequently even for 300dpi modes (strange path, 
    Undefined x coordinate has been replaced by 0)

ecit0800
tcit0900

Two bugs reported by mitek@email.cz (not fixed yet, because I want to get out
the licence update really soon)

 2. The 'Copyleft' in txsymbol.mf has a different shape of the upper
    serif than (reversed) 'C'. I think that there must be
    opposite sign in the equation for x1' (something like
    x1l-x1'=-2cap_curve+fine). (The same bug is in
    cmbright/ttsymbol.mf, but this is not visible due to char shape).

 3. The 'Superscript numeral 3' in txrsuper.mf has its upper bulb
    positioned too low. I think that there was ommited the replacement of
    y0=min(.9h-.5bulb_diam1,.75[bot y8r,h]+.5bulb_diam1);
    with
    y0=min(.9[bot y8r,h]-.5bulb_diam1,.75[bot y8r,h]+.5bulb_diam1);
    as is done in other equations and in 'Fraction three quarters'.
