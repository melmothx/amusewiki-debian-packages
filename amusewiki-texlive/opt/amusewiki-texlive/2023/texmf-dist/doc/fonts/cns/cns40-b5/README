This is the README file of the cns40-b5.tar.gz package. 

It contains an HBF header file for a Big 5 encoded font built up from CNS
bitmap fonts planes 1-3 (the bitmaps itself are in the cns40-1 - cns40-3
packages), an hbf2gf configuration file and .tfm files to be used with the
CJK package for LaTeX2e.

The package follows the TDS directory structure.
