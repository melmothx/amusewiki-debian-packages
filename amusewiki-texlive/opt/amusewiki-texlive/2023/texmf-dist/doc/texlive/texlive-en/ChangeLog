	* texlive-en.tex: let's try [12pt].
	* tex-live.sty: adjust \geometry.
	Have to fix plenty of under/overfull boxes, but maybe worth it.

2023-05-22  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* texlive-en.tex
	(2020): x86_64-darwinlegacy dropped X11.
	(2023): for 32-bit Windows, TL22 must be installed; mention
	Windows ARM emulation status.
	(2023): LuaTeX 1.17.0 post-release update.

2023-03-01  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* texlive-en.tex (sec:tl-coll-dists): fix section title to have
	MiKTeX also.
	(throughout): use \ConTeXt\ more consistently.

2023-02-26  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* texlive-en.tex (sec:tl-coll-dists): replace proTeXt with MiKTeX;
	other tweaks.
	(throughout): use \TL\ more consistently.

2022-12-26  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* texlive-en.tex (sysfontconfig): update to something closer to
	current reality. See thread both before and after:
	https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2022-December/048733.html

2022-03-19  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* Makefile (html-separate): remove spurious `.
	* texlive-en.tex: missing \ref, found by Takuto.

2022-01-26  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* tex-live.sty: # is not TeX comment character.
	Publish new pdf/html, since changes so far aren't 2022-specific,
	and getting alt text out now seems like it wouldn't hurt.

2022-01-25  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* tex-live.sty (\tlpng): require new third argument for alt text.
	* texlive-en.tex: change all \tlpng calls.
	* live4ht.cfg (graphics*): remove \Configure, redundant with
	\tlpng macro now.

	* Makefile (env): texlive-en before texlive-common,
	for sake of example.
	(run_htlatex, htopts1, htopts2): new variables to separate out the
	htlatex invocation.
	(html1 h): new targets to just run htlatex once.
