Description
This file contain the necessary and supplementary data for 
typesetting documents in Italian with babel as the language 
manager.
It defines the infix words, the date in various formats. 
Optionally lets the user activate a number of shorthands to 
perform routine frequent tasks by means of the active 
character " that can be freely activated and deactivated. 
It defines an intelligent mathematical comma that recognises 
if it has to perform as a punctuation mark or as a decimal 
separator.
It defines an 'english" environment that deactivates the 
intelligent comma functionality, but it is the user 
responsibility to use the decimal point in any fractional 
numerical string.
Another user command activates or deactivates some commands 
to supply a minimum of the performance that is fully provided 
by the siunitx and similar packages. The file allows using 
babel also when a document is typeset with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.

The documentation that is provided by running LaTeX on the 
italian.dtx file provides full documentation of every facility 
provided by the italian.ldf file.

The documentation contains the licence clauses.
