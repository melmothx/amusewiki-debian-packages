\opening{Dear Madam Chair,}
The last general meeting was more than a year ago.
I would like to remind you that the articles of our
club stipulate that one should be held every
six months. For this reason, I call on the executive
board to arrange such a meeting immediately.
\closing{Anticipating an invitation}
\ps PS: I hope you do not take this request amiss.
