xpinyin
=======

`xpinyin` is a LaTeX package written to simplify the input of Hanyu Pinyin.
The package provides macros to automatically add pinyin to Chinese characters.
It can only be used in conjunction with `xeCJK` or `CJK/CJKutf8` package.

Given that the implementation of pinyin package of `CJK` bundle is not very
well, it seems that xpinyin is a good replacement of it.

You can read the package manual (in Chinese) for more detailed explanations.
