shortdesc Unicode algorithms for LuaTeX
longdesc Lua code working with Unicode data has to deal with quite some
longdesc challenges. For example there are many canonically equivalent
longdesc sequences which should be treated in the same way, and even
longdesc identifying a single character becomes quite different once you
longdesc have to deal with all kinds of combining characters, emoji
longdesc sequences and syllables in different scripts. Therefore
longdesc lua-uni-algos wants to build a collection of small libraries
longdesc implementing algorithms to deal with lots of the details in
longdesc Unicode, such that authors of LuaTeX packages can focus on
longdesc their actual functionality instead of having to fight against
longdesc the peculiarities of Unicode. Given that this package provides
longdesc Lua modules, it is only useful in Lua(HB)TeX. Additionally, it
longdesc expects an up-to-date version of the unicode-data package to be
longdesc present. This package is intended for package authors only; no
longdesc user-level functionality provided.
