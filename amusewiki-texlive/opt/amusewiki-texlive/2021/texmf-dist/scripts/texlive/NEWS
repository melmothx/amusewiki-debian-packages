<p><b>tlmgr 51555 (released 5jul19):</b>
<li>runscript.tlu: use vbscript for GUI error boxes, so tlshell can be
its own self-contained package, entirely separate from texlive.infra.

<p><b>tlmgr 50796 (released 7apr19):</b>

<p><b>tlmgr 49226 (released 23nov18):</b>
<li>new environment variable TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN to prefer compression
(e.g., xz) and download (e.g., wget) programs shipped with TL to those
provided by the system.

<p><b>tlmgr 48598 (released 29oct18):</b>
<li>remove debugging line for caller() left in by mistake.
<li>update ctan backbone list (to the one remaining).

<p><b>tlmgr 48522 (released 3sep18):</b>

<p><b>tlmgr 48271 (released 25jul18):</b>

  compressor and download programs.
<li>tlmgr info now allows listing only packages from the remote 
  repository using <tt>--only-remote</tt>.
<li>further checks on downloaded signature files to reduce
  spurious warnings.
<li>save alias information from TeX Catalogue.

<p><b>tlmgr 47951 (released 07jun18):</b>
<li>Backup removal for non-xz.

<p><b>tlmgr 47935 (released 05-06jun18):</b>
<li>Bug fix for lz4 backups (need <tt>-m</tt> for normal behavior).

<p><b>tlmgr 47907 (released 03jun18):</b>
<li>support for curl as a download program, and new default behavior for
choosing. In this order:
  <ol>
  <li>If the environment variable <tt>TEXLIVE_DOWNLOADER</tt> is
      defined, use it; abort if the specified program doesn't work.
      Possible values: <tt>curl</tt>, <tt>wget</tt>.
  <li>If the environment variable <tt>TL_DOWNLOAD_PROGRAM</tt> is
      defined (can be any value), use it together with
      <tt>TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS</tt>; abort if it doesn't work.
  <li>If LWP is available and working, use that (by far the most
      efficient method, as it supports persistent downloads).
  <li>If curl is available (from the system) and working, use that.
  <li>If wget is available (either from the system or TL) and
      working, use that.
  </ol>
  <p>TL still provides <tt>wget</tt> binaries for some platforms, so
  some download method should always be available.
  
<li>support for alternative compressor programs; until now, backups and
  intermediate rollback containers were always created with xz. Now:
  <ol>
  <li>If the environment variable <tt>TEXLIVE_COMPRESSOR</tt> is
      defined, use it; abort if it doesn't work. Possible values:
      <tt>lz4</tt>, <tt>gzip</tt>, <tt>xz</tt>.
  <li>If lz4 is available (either from the system or TL) and working, use that.
  <li>If gzip is available (from the system) and working, use that.
  <li>If xz is available (either from the system or TL) and working, use that.
  </ol>
  <p>lz4 and gzip are much faster in creating tlmgr's local backups.
  The unconditional use of xz for the tlnet containers is unaffected,
  to minimize download sizes.

<li><a href="https://openssh.com/">ssh</a> support: installing from a
  repository of the form <tt>user@machine:/path/to/tlnet</tt> is now
  supported; the url-like forms
  <tt>scp://user@machine/path/to/tlnet</tt> and
  <tt>ssh://user@machine/path/to/tlnet</tt> are equivalent. ssh-agent
  is strongly recommended!

<li>Not tlmgr, but close enough: our generic Windows wrapper
runscript.tlu now sets <tt>LC_CTYPE</tt> to be the system encoding, to
support files with non-ASCII characters.

<p><b>tlmgr 47303 (released 14apr18):</b>
<li>uninstall now a synonym for remove, so requiring --all to remove the
TeX&nbsp;Live installation.

<p><b>tlmgr 46207 (released 31jan18):</b>
<li>new action/option print-platform-info to dump platform name(s) as
  well as the identifier.
<li>fix integrity checks to include checksum and not only size.
<li>remove support for md5 checksums (unused for a long time).

<p><b>tlmgr 46034 (released 12dec17):</b>
<li>tlmgr info (list): reinstate previous (and intended) list format.
<li>tlmgr info: only load remote tlpdb when necessary.
<li>(Windows) do not run post-actions when luatex.dll is not
  available (because runscript needs luatex).

<p><b>tlmgr 45838 (released 23nov17):</b>
<li>allow excluding packages from update in tlmgr config file.
<li>JSON output for various commands.
<li>other machine-readable improvements.

<p><b>tlmgr 45286 (released 15sep17):</b>
<li>require the main repository to be signed.
<li>fix tlmgr info output.

<p><b>tlmgr 45190 (released 1sep17):</b>
<li>fix tlmgrgui not to switch to single repo mode on CTAN mirror usage.
<li>prohibit upgrades between releases using tlmgr.
<li>add shell mode.
<li>add tabulated info output.

<p><b>tlmgr 44452 (released 9jun17):</b>
<li>bug fix for tlmgr conf editing of line continuations.

<p><b>tlmgr 44422 (TeX Live 2017):</b>
<li>new action <tt>shell</tt> for interactive and scripted use.
<li>new action <tt>conf auxtrees</tt> to easily add and remove extra
  texmf trees.
<li>if backups are enabled, a backup is automatically made by the
  <tt>remove</tt> action.
<li>the <tt>info</tt> output includes sizes for schemes and collections.

<p><b>tlmgr 41476 (released 20jun16):</b>
<li>fix <tt>tlmgr restore</tt> failure

<p><b>tlmgr 41258 (TeX Live 2016, 19may16):</b>
<li>support for system-level configuration files in 
<tt>TEXMFSYSCONFIG/tlmgr/config</tt>, where a restricted set of allowed
actions can be defined, in addition to the usual tlmgr config file
directives.
<li>the font and other gui controls can be specified as options to the
<tt>gui</tt> action.
<li>verify package checksums during installation; sha-512 used instead
of md5 for checksums; new config file setting <tt>no-checksums</tt>.
<li>gpg verification supported, with new action <tt>key</tt> and new
options and config settings <tt>--require-verification</tt> and
<tt>verify-downloads</tt>.
<li>unify installer and tlmgr package installation implementations.

<p><b>tlmgr revision 39198 (released 5jan16):</b>
<li>message and doc changes.
<li>ConTeXt paper size changes.

<p><b>tlmgr revision 37738 (released 3jul15):</b>
<li>more accurate error codes, e.g., for paper sizes.
<li>info searches titles, descriptions, file names, topics if available.

<p><b>tlmgr revision 37030 (released 24apr15):</b>
<li>more reliable exit status codes.
<li>add --with-doc and --with-src options for use with install --reinstall,
to get the doc and/or src files even if they were omitted at initial
installation.
<li>the install action reports explicitly-requested packages already installed.
<li>restore --dry-run is now more of a no-op, as intended.

<p><b>tlmgr revision 35841 (released 24dec14):</b>
<li>remove taxonomy searching, since upstream data is no longer maintained.

<p><b>tlmgr revision 34227 (released 23may14, TeX Live 2014):</b>
<li>If the NOPERLDOC envvar is set, avoid fancy <tt>--help</tt> message
formatting, regardless.  (Same holds for install-tl.)
<li><tt>tlmgr conf</tt> supports new options <tt>--delete</tt>,
<tt>--conffile</tt>, and <tt>updmap</tt>.
<li>doc and error checking updates as usual.
