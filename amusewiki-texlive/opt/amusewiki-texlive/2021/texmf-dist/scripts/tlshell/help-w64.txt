!!! 64-BIT BINARIES ARE UNOFFICAL !!!

If you did not press the ABOUT menu item, you probably did not
previously add 64-bit binaries with this graphical interface.

The 64-bit binaries that you can add with this interface are an
UNOFFICAL addition to TeX Live.

They are created by Akira Kakuto, who also maintains most 32-bit
binaries for TeX Live.

Installing these 64-bit binaries will NOT change your searchpath to
include them. Instead, a new command-prompt shortcut, titled 'TeX
Live 64-bit' will be created which prefers the 64-bit binaries over
the 32-bit ones. You can also configure your editor to prefer
64-bit, but that is up to you.

Shortcut creation may fail on Windows 7.

WARNING

If the 64-bit binaries are not in step with the 32-bit ones, you
might run into problems with format files. When an update involves a
TeX compiler ([la]tex, pdf[la]tex, lua[la]tex, xe[la]tex) or
metafont/metapost, it is best to also rerun this 64-bit installer.
THIS IS YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY!

Normal 32-bit operation should not be affected, but this also
depends on your editor configuration.


RE-SYNCING

Another consideration is the actual set of 64-bit binaries which are
installed. When installing or updating them, 64-bit binaries which
do not have a corresponding 32-bit binary are automatically
removed. Therefore, if you add or remove packages, you should also
do a re-sync, or an update, which includes a re-sync.


GHOSTSCRIPT

You may need to also install a 64-bit ghostscript. An installer can
be downloaded from https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/win32/TLW64/
