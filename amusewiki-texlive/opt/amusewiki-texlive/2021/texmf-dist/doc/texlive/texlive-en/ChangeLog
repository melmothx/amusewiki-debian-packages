	* tex-live.sty: # is not TeX comment character.
	Publish new pdf/html, since changes so far aren't 2022-specific,
	and getting alt text out now seems like it wouldn't hurt.

	* tex-live.sty (\tlpng): require new third argument for alt text.
	* texlive-en.tex: change all \tlpng calls.
	* live4ht.cfg (graphics*): remove \Configure, redundant with
	\tlpng macro now.

	* Makefile (env): texlive-en before texlive-common,
	for sake of example.
	(run_htlatex, htopts1, htopts2): new variables to separate out the
	htlatex invocation.
	(html1 h): new targets to just run htlatex once.
