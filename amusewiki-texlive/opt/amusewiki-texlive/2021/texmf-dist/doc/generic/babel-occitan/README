Package: babel-occitan


The package provides a language definition file for use with babel, which establishes 
Occitan conventions in a document (or a subset of the conventions, if Occitan is not 
the main language of the document).

Some functionalities have to be explicitly activated even if Occitan is the main 
language. Please read the documentation that explains why and what functionalities 
are not activated by default.

To install run the occitan.dtx file trough pdfLaTeX; you get with the same run 
both the language description file and the documentation.. Then you have to 
move the created occitan.ldf file into a directory searched by TeX.
