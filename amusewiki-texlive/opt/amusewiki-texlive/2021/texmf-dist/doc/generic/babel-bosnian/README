Package: babel-bosnian
Version: 1.1
Dated: 20/08/2015

The package provides language definition files for use with babel, which
establishes Bosnian conventions in a document (or a subset of the
conventions, if Bosnian is not the main language of the document).

To install run the bosnian.ins file trough the TeX compiler. Then move
the created bosnian.ldf file into a directory searched by TeX.

To produce the documentation run the file bosnian.dtx through LaTeX.
