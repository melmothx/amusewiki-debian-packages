Vietnamese Support for Babel
============================

This bundle contains the Babel support files for Vietnamese.  Since version
1.3 it supersedes the Babel support files in the VnTeX bundle.


Version 1.4 (2015-Dec-31)
-------------------------

Javier Bezos contributed better Unicode support for XeTeX and luatex,
avoiding a dependency on the (8-bit) T5 font encoding for those two engines.
