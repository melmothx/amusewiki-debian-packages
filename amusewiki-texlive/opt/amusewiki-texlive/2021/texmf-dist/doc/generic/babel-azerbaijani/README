Azerbaijani 1.0a
------------

This is the babel style for Azerbaijani.

This language poses special challenges because no "traditional" font
encoding contains the full character set, and therefore a mixture must
be used (eg, T2A and T1).

It's compatible with Unicode engines (luatex, xetex), which are
very likely the most convenient way to write Azerbaijani documents.

The manual explains how to handle the fi ligature, too.
