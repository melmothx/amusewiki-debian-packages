The .icc files were generated from the .xml files using 
cd-create-profile from the colord package by 
Peter Selinger.

Quote from his email 
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2018-September/042340.html
/-----
| The ICC files were generated from the XML files by me, today, using
| the open-source program /usr/bin/cd-create-profile, which is also part
| of the Debian colord-1.4.3 package.
|
| Since the ICC files just contain the information from the XML files in
| a different data format, the ICC files are not in themselves original
| works and therefore not copyrightable in their own right. However, for
| greater clarity, to the extent that I have any rights to these files
| as their creator, I hereby waive all of my rights to the work
| worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring
| rights, to the extent allowed by law.
| 
| Each ICC files also contains a UTF-16 encoding of the statement "This
| profile is free of known copyright restrictions".
