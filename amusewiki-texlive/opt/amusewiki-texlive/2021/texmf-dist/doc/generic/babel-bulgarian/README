Bulgarian language definition file version 1.2g for Babel.
----------

To install, run latex on bulgarian.ins. This creates the file
bulgarian.ldf.  Use this newly created file to replace the
existing file with the same name in your TeX installation (for MikTeX on
Windows this may be something like 
c:\Program Files\Miktex 2.9\tex\generic\babel\bulgarian.ldf).

Report bugs to Georgi Boshnakov.

See  bulgarian.pdf for usage details. 

Changes are described in bulgarian.pdf (section Change history).
