This is the README file of the gbsn00lp-20071107.tar.gz package.

The original font file is

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/chinese-fonts-truetype/gbsn00lp.ttf.gz

It has been first converted with the FontForge script `subfonts.pe' to
create a set of Unicode encoded subfonts, then with the perl script
`uni2sfd.pl' to create virtual fonts which provide GB 2312 encoded subfonts
as used by the CJK package for LaTeX.

  fontforge -script subfonts.pe gbsn00lp.ttf gbsnu Unicode.sfd

  perl uni2sfd.pl gbsnu UGB.sfd gbsnlp cjkgb

  rm *.enc

These two scripts are part of the CJK package. You need FontForge 20071105
or newer to run the scripts by yourself.

This font package follows the TDS directory structure; the font family names
for Unicode and GB font encodings are `gbsnu' and `gbsnlp', respectively.
For installation, simply copy the files to the corresponding locations in
your TEXMF tree. LaTeX font definition files and example files for testing
can be found in the CJK package.

History:

  2005-Jun-19  First version.

  2007-Nov-07  Regenerate all PFB files which are now more compact due to
               optimizations in FontForge.

               Fix TFM files to avoid negative depth values (the widths stay
               unchanged).
