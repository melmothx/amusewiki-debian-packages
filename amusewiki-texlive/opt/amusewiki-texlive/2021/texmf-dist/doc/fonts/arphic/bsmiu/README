This is the README file of the bsmi00lp-20071105.tar.gz package.

The original font file is

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/chinese-fonts-truetype/bsmi00lp.ttf.gz

It has been first converted with the FontForge script `subfonts.pe' to
create a set of Unicode encoded subfonts, then with the perl script
`uni2sfd.pl' to create virtual fonts which provide Big5 encoded subfonts as
used by the CJK package for LaTeX. Finally, the scripts `vertical.pe' and
`clonevf.pl' have been used to extract fonts with vertical glyph
representation forms (`bsmiuv' and `bsmilpv').

  fontforge -script subfonts.pe bsmi00lp.ttf bsmiu Unicode.sfd
  fontforge -script vertical.pe bsmi00lp.ttf bsmiuv
  fontforge -script vertref.pe bsmi00lp.ttf bsmiuvr

  perl uni2sfd.pl bsmiu UBig5.sfd bsmilp cjkbig5
  perl clonevf.pl bsmiuv bsmilpv

  rm *.enc
  rm bsmiuvr.*

These scripts are part of the CJK package. You need FontForge 20071105 or
newer to run the scripts by yourself.

This font package follows the TDS directory structure; the font family names
for Unicode and Big5 font encodings are `bsmiu' and `bsmilp', respectively.
For installation, simply copy the files to the corresponding locations in
your TEXMF tree. LaTeX font definition files and example files for testing
can be found in the CJK package.

History:

  2005-Jun-19  First version.

  2007-Nov-05  Fix glyph names in bsmiuv.pfb so that dvipdfmx can deduce
               correct glyph names for /ToUnicode CMaps.

               Regenerate all PFB files which are now more compact by
               almost 10% due to optimizations in FontForge.

               Fix TFM files to avoid negative depth values (the widths stay
               unchanged).
