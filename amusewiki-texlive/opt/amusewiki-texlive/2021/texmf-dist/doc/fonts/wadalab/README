These are font bundles for the Japanese Wadalab fonts which work with
the CJK package.

All subfonts now have glyph names compliant to the Adobe Glyph List,
making ToUnicode CMaps in PDF documents (created automatically by
dvipdfmx) work correctly.

All font bundles now contain virtual Unicode subfonts.

This package was uploaded to CTAN by Werner Lemberg.
