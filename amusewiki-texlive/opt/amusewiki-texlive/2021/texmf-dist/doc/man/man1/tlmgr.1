tlmgr \- the native TeX Live Manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
tlmgr [\fIoption\fR...] \fIaction\fR [\fIoption\fR...] [\fIoperand\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBtlmgr\fR manages an existing TeX Live installation, both packages and
configuration options.  For information on initially downloading and
installing TeX Live, see <https://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html>.
.PP
The most up-to-date version of this documentation (updated nightly from
the development sources) is available at
<https://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>, along with procedures for updating
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR itself and information about test versions.
.PP
TeX Live is organized into a few top-level \fIschemes\fR, each of which is
specified as a different set of \fIcollections\fR and \fIpackages\fR, where a
collection is a set of packages, and a package is what contains actual
files.  Schemes typically contain a mix of collections and packages, but
each package is included in exactly one collection, no more and no less.
A TeX Live installation can be customized and managed at any level.
.PP
See <https://tug.org/texlive/doc> for all the TeX Live documentation
available.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
After successfully installing TeX Live, here are a few common operations
with \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR:
.ie n .IP """tlmgr option repository ctan""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtlmgr option repository ctan\fR" 4
.IX Item "tlmgr option repository ctan"

.el .IP "\f(CWtlmgr option repository https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet\fR" 4
.IX Item "tlmgr option repository https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet"
.PD
Tell \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR to use a nearby \s-1CTAN\s0 mirror for future updates; useful if
you installed TeX Live from the \s-1DVD\s0 image and want to have continuing
updates.  The two commands are equivalent; \f(CW\*(C`ctan\*(C'\fR is just an alias for
the given url.
.Sp
Caveat: \f(CW\*(C`mirror.ctan.org\*(C'\fR resolves to many different hosts, and they
are not perfectly synchronized; we recommend updating only daily (at
most), and not more often. You can choose a particular mirror if
problems; the list of all \s-1CTAN\s0 mirrors with the status of each is at
<https://ctan.org/mirrors/mirmon>.
.ie n .IP """tlmgr update \-\-list""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtlmgr update \-\-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "tlmgr update --list"
Report what would be updated without actually updating anything.
.ie n .IP """tlmgr update \-\-all""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtlmgr update \-\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "tlmgr update --all"
Make your local TeX installation correspond to what is in the package
repository (typically useful when updating from \s-1CTAN\s0).
.ie n .IP """tlmgr info"" \fIwhat\fR" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtlmgr info\fR \fIwhat\fR" 4
.IX Item "tlmgr info what"
Display detailed information about a package \fIwhat\fR, such as the installation
status and description, of searches for \fIwhat\fR in all packages.
.PP
For all the capabilities and details of \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR, please read the
following voluminous information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The following options to \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR are global options, not specific to
any action.  All options, whether global or action-specific, can be
given anywhere on the command line, and in any order.  The first
non-option argument will be the main action.  In all cases,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR\fIoption\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR\fIoption\fR are equivalent, and an \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR is optional
between an option name and its value.
.IP "\fB\-\-repository\fR \fIurl|path\fR" 4
.IX Item "--repository url|path"
Specify the package repository from which packages should be installed
or updated, either a local directory or network location, as below. This
overridesthe default package repository found in the installation's TeX
Live Package Database (a.k.a. the \s-1TLPDB,\s0 which is given entirely in the
file \f(CW\*(C`tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
This \f(CW\*(C`\-\-repository\*(C'\fR option changes the location only for the current
run; to make a permanent change, use \f(CW\*(C`option repository\*(C'\fR (see the
\&\*(L"option\*(R" action).
.Sp
As an example, you can choose a particular \s-1CTAN\s0 mirror with something
like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  \-repository http://ctan.example.org/its/ctan/dir/systems/texlive/tlnet
.Ve
.Sp
Of course a real hostname and its particular top-level \s-1CTAN\s0 directory
have to be specified.  The list of \s-1CTAN\s0 mirrors is available at
<https://ctan.org/mirrors/mirmon>.
.Sp
Here's an example of using a local directory:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  \-repository /local/TL/repository
.Ve
.Sp
For backward compatibility and convenience, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-location\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-repo\*(C'\fR
are accepted as aliases for this option.
.Sp
Locations can be specified as any of the following:
.RS 4

.IX Item "https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet"
.PD
Pick a \s-1CTAN\s0 mirror automatically, trying for one that is both nearby and
up-to-date. The chosen mirror is used for the entire download. The bare
\&\f(CW\*(C`ctan\*(C'\fR is merely an alias for the full url. (See <https://ctan.org> for
more about \s-1CTAN\s0 and its mirrors.)
.ie n .IP """http://server/path/to/tlnet""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhttp://server/path/to/tlnet\fR" 4
.IX Item "http://server/path/to/tlnet"
Standard \s-1HTTP.\s0 If the (default) \s-1LWP\s0 method is used, persistent
connections are supported. \s-1TL\s0 can also use \f(CW\*(C`curl\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`wget\*(C'\fR to do the
downloads, or an arbitrary user-specified program, as described in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR documentation
(<https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#ENVIRONMENT\-VARIABLES>).
.ie n .IP """https://server/path/to/tlnet""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhttps://server/path/to/tlnet\fR" 4
.IX Item "https://server/path/to/tlnet"
Again, if the (default) \s-1LWP\s0 method is used, this supports persistent
connections. Unfortunately, some versions of \f(CW\*(C`wget\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`curl\*(C'\fR do not
support https, and even when \f(CW\*(C`wget\*(C'\fR supports https, certificates may be
rejected even when the certificate is fine, due to a lack of local
certificate roots. The simplest workaround for this problem is to use
http or ftp.
.ie n .IP """ftp://server/path/to/tlnet""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWftp://server/path/to/tlnet\fR" 4
.IX Item "ftp://server/path/to/tlnet"
If the (default) \s-1LWP\s0 method is used, persistent connections are
supported.

These forms are equivalent; they all use \f(CW\*(C`scp\*(C'\fR to transfer files. Using
\&\f(CW\*(C`ssh\-agent\*(C'\fR is recommended. (Info:

If the repository is on the network, trailing \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR characters and/or
trailing \f(CW\*(C`/tlpkg\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`/archive\*(C'\fR components are ignored.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-\-gui\fR [\fIaction\fR]" 4
.IX Item "--gui [action]"
Two notable \s-1GUI\s0 front-ends for \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tlshell\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`tlcockpit\*(C'\fR,
are started up as separate programs; see their own documentation.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR itself has a graphical interface as well as the command line
interface. You can give the option to invoke it, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-gui\*(C'\fR, together with
an action to be brought directly into the respective screen of the \s-1GUI.\s0
For example, running
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  tlmgr \-\-gui update
.Ve
.Sp
starts you directly at the update screen.  If no action is given, the
\&\s-1GUI\s0 will be started at the main screen.  See \*(L"\s-1GUI FOR TLMGR\*(R"\s0.
.Sp
However, the native \s-1GUI\s0 requires Perl/TK, which is no longer included in
TeX Live's Perl distribution for Windows. You may find \f(CW\*(C`tlshell\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlcockpit\*(C'\fR easier to work with.
.IP "\fB\-\-gui\-lang\fR \fIllcode\fR" 4
.IX Item "--gui-lang llcode"
By default, the \s-1GUI\s0 tries to deduce your language from the environment
(on Windows via the registry, on Unix via \f(CW\*(C`LC_MESSAGES\*(C'\fR). If that fails
you can select a different language by giving this option with a
language code (based on \s-1ISO 639\-1\s0). Currently supported (but not
necessarily completely translated) are: English\ (en,\ default),
Czech\ (cs), German\ (de), French\ (fr), Italian\ (it),
Japanese\ (ja), Dutch\ (nl), Polish\ (pl), Brazilian\ Portuguese\ (pt_BR), Russian\ (ru), Slovak\ (sk), Slovenian\ (sl), Serbian\ (sr), Ukrainian\ (uk), Vietnamese\ (vi), simplified\ Chinese\ (zh_CN), and traditional\ Chinese\ (zh_TW).
.Sp
tlshell shares its message catalog with tlmgr.
.IP "\fB\-\-command\-logfile\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--command-logfile file"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR logs the output of all programs invoked (mktexlr, mtxrun, fmtutil,
updmap) to a separate log file, by default
\&\f(CW\*(C`TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/tlmgr\-commands.log\*(C'\fR.  This option allows you to specify a
different file for the log.
.IP "\fB\-\-debug\-translation\fR" 4
.IX Item "--debug-translation"
In \s-1GUI\s0 mode, this switch tells \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR to report any untranslated (or
missing) messages to standard error.  This can help translators to see
what remains to be done.
.IP "\fB\-\-machine\-readable\fR" 4
.IX Item "--machine-readable"
Instead of the normal output intended for human consumption, write (to
standard output) a fixed format more suitable for machine parsing.  See
the \*(L"MACHINE-READABLE \s-1OUTPUT\*(R"\s0 section below.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-execute\-actions\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-execute-actions"
Suppress the execution of the execute actions as defined in the tlpsrc
files.  Documented only for completeness, as this is only useful in
debugging.
.IP "\fB\-\-package\-logfile\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--package-logfile file"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR logs all package actions (install, remove, update, failed
updates, failed restores) to a separate log file, by default
\&\f(CW\*(C`TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/tlmgr.log\*(C'\fR.  This option allows you to specify a
different file for the log.
.IP "\fB\-\-pause\fR" 4
.IX Item "--pause"
This option makes \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR wait for user input before exiting.  Useful on
Windows to avoid disappearing command windows.
.IP "\fB\-\-persistent\-downloads\fR" 4
.IX Item "--persistent-downloads"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-persistent\-downloads\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-persistent-downloads"
.PD
For network-based installations, this option (on by default) makes
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR try to set up a persistent connection (using the \f(CW\*(C`LWP\*(C'\fR Perl
module).  The idea is to open and reuse only one connection per session
between your computer and the server, instead of initiating a new
download for each package.
.Sp
If this is not possible, \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR will fall back to using \f(CW\*(C`wget\*(C'\fR.  To
disable these persistent connections, use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-persistent\-downloads\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-pin\-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--pin-file"
Change the pinning file location from \f(CW\*(C`TEXMFLOCAL/tlpkg/pinning.txt\*(C'\fR
(see \*(L"Pinning\*(R" below).  Documented only for completeness, as this is
only useful in debugging.
.IP "\fB\-\-usermode\fR" 4

Activates user mode for this run of \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR; see \*(L"\s-1USER MODE\*(R"\s0 below.

Defines the level of verification done: If \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR is specified, no
verification whatsoever is done. If \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR is given and a working GnuPG
(\f(CW\*(C`gpg\*(C'\fR) binary is available, all repositories are checked, but only the
main repository is required to be signed. If \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR is given, then all

The \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR value shown by \f(CW\*(C`conf\*(C'\fR is as used by \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR.  The
directory in which the \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR executable is found is automatically
prepended to the \s-1PATH\s0 value inherited from the environment.
.Sp
Here is a practical example of changing configuration values. If the
execution of (some or all) system commands via \f(CW\*(C`\ewrite18\*(C'\fR was left
enabled during installation, you can disable it afterwards:
.Sp
.Vb 1

The subcommand \f(CW\*(C`auxtrees\*(C'\fR allows adding and removing arbitrary
additional texmf trees, completely under user control.  \f(CW\*(C`auxtrees show\*(C'\fR
shows the list of additional trees, \f(CW\*(C`auxtrees add\*(C'\fR \fItree\fR adds a tree
to the list, and \f(CW\*(C`auxtrees remove\*(C'\fR \fItree\fR removes a tree from the list
(if present). The trees should not contain an \f(CW\*(C`ls\-R\*(C'\fR file (or files
will not be found if the \f(CW\*(C`ls\-R\*(C'\fR becomes stale). This works by
manipulating the Kpathsea variable \f(CW\*(C`TEXMFAUXTREES\*(C'\fR, in (by default)
\&\f(CW\*(C`ROOT/texmf.cnf\*(C'\fR.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2

In all cases the configuration file can be explicitly specified via the
option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-conffile\*(C'\fR \fIfile\fR, e.g., if you don't want to change the
system-wide configuration.
.Sp
Warning: The general facility for changing configuration values is here,
but tinkering with settings in this way is strongly discouraged.  Again,
no error checking on either keys or values is done, so any sort of
breakage is possible.

.PD
The action \f(CW\*(C`key\*(C'\fR allows listing, adding and removing additional \s-1GPG\s0
keys to the set of trusted keys, that is, those that are used to verify
the TeX Live databases.
.Sp
With the \f(CW\*(C`list\*(C'\fR argument, \f(CW\*(C`key\*(C'\fR lists all keys.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`add\*(C'\fR argument requires another argument, either a filename or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR for stdin, from which the key is added. The key is added to the
local keyring \f(CW\*(C`GNUPGHOME/repository\-keys.gpg\*(C'\fR, which is normally
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlpkg/gpg/repository\-keys.gpg\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`remove\*(C'\fR argument requires a key id and removes the requested id
from the local keyring.

One common use of \f(CW\*(C`option\*(C'\fR is to permanently change the installation to

The \f(CW\*(C`install\-tl\*(C'\fR documentation has more information about the possible
values for \f(CW\*(C`repository\*(C'\fR.  (For backward compatibility, \f(CW\*(C`location\*(C'\fR can
be used as a synonym for \f(CW\*(C`repository\*(C'\fR.)
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`formats\*(C'\fR is set (this is the default), then formats are regenerated
when either the engine or the format files have changed.  Disable this
only when you know how and want to regenerate formats yourself whenever
needed (which is often, in practice).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`postcode\*(C'\fR option controls execution of per-package
postinstallation action code.  It is set by default, and again disabling
is not likely to be of interest except to developers doing debugging.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`docfiles\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`srcfiles\*(C'\fR options control the installation of
their respective file groups (documentation, sources; grouping is
approximate) per package. By default both are enabled (1).  Either or
both can be disabled (set to 0) if disk space is limited or for minimal
testing installations, etc.  When disabled, the respective files are not
downloaded at all.
.PP
The options \f(CW\*(C`autobackup\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`backupdir\*(C'\fR determine the defaults for
the actions \f(CW\*(C`update\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`backup\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`restore\*(C'\fR. These three actions
need a directory in which to read or write the backups. If
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-backupdir\*(C'\fR is not specified on the command line, the \f(CW\*(C`backupdir\*(C'\fR
option value is used (if set). The \s-1TL\s0 installer sets \f(CW\*(C`backupdir\*(C'\fR to
\&\f(CW\*(C`.../tlpkg/backups\*(C'\fR, under the \s-1TL\s0 root installation directory.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`autobackup\*(C'\fR option (de)activates automatic generation of backups.
Its value is an integer.  If the \f(CW\*(C`autobackup\*(C'\fR value is \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR, no
backups are removed.  If \f(CW\*(C`autobackup\*(C'\fR is 0 or more, it specifies the
number of backups to keep.  Thus, backups are disabled if the value is
0.  In the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-clean\*(C'\fR mode of the \f(CW\*(C`backup\*(C'\fR action this option also
specifies the number to be kept.  The default value is 1, so that
backups are made, but only one backup is kept.
.PP
To setup \f(CW\*(C`autobackup\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR on the command line, use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  tlmgr option \-\- autobackup \-1
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR avoids having the \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR treated as an option.  (The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR
stops parsing for options at the point where it appears; this is a
general feature across most Unix programs.)
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`sys_bin\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sys_man\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`sys_info\*(C'\fR options are used on Unix
systems to control the generation of links for executables, Info files
and man pages. See the \f(CW\*(C`path\*(C'\fR action for details.
.PP
The last three options affect behavior on Windows installations.  If
\&\f(CW\*(C`desktop_integration\*(C'\fR is set, then some packages will install items in
a sub-folder of the Start menu for \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr gui\*(C'\fR, documentation, etc.  If
\&\f(CW\*(C`fileassocs\*(C'\fR is set, Windows file associations are made (see also the
\&\f(CW\*(C`postaction\*(C'\fR action).  Finally, if \f(CW\*(C`multiuser\*(C'\fR is set, then adaptions
to the registry and the menus are done for all users on the system
instead of only the current user.  All three options are on by default.

Incidentally, this syntax of having a specific program name before the

Starts an interactive mode, where tlmgr prompts for commands. This can
be used directly, or for scripting. The first line of output is
\&\f(CW\*(C`protocol\*(C'\fR \fIn\fR, where \fIn\fR is an unsigned number identifying the
protocol version (currently 1).
.PP
In general, tlmgr actions that can be given on the command line
translate to commands in this shell mode.  For example, you can say
\&\f(CW\*(C`update \-\-list\*(C'\fR to see what would be updated. The \s-1TLPDB\s0 is loaded the
first time it is needed (not at the beginning), and used for the rest of
the session.
.PP
Besides these actions, a few commands are specific to shell mode:
.IP "protocol" 4
.IX Item "protocol"
Print \f(CW\*(C`protocol \f(CIn\f(CW\*(C'\fR, the current protocol version.
.IP "help" 4
.IX Item "help"
Print pointers to this documentation.
.IP "version" 4
.IX Item "version"
Print tlmgr version information.
.IP "quit, end, bye, byebye, \s-1EOF\s0" 4
.IX Item "quit, end, bye, byebye, EOF"
Exit.
.IP "restart" 4
.IX Item "restart"
Restart \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr shell\*(C'\fR with the original command line; most useful when
developing \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR.
.IP "load [local|remote]" 4
.IX Item "load [local|remote]"
Explicitly load the local or remote, respectively, \s-1TLPDB.\s0
.IP "save" 4
.IX Item "save"
Save the local \s-1TLPDB,\s0 presumably after other operations have changed it.
.IP "get [\fIvar\fR] =item set [\fIvar\fR [\fIval\fR]]" 4
.IX Item "get [var] =item set [var [val]]"
Get the value of \fIvar\fR, or set it to \fIval\fR.  Possible \fIvar\fR names:
\&\f(CW\*(C`debug\-translation\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`machine\-readable\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`no\-execute\-actions\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`require\-verification\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`verify\-downloads\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`repository\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`prompt\*(C'\fR. All except \f(CW\*(C`repository\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`prompt\*(C'\fR are booleans, taking
values 0 and 1, and behave like the corresponding command line option.
The \f(CW\*(C`repository\*(C'\fR variable takes a string, and sets the remote
repository location. The \f(CW\*(C`prompt\*(C'\fR variable takes a string, and sets the
current default prompt.
.Sp
If \fIvar\fR or then \fIval\fR is not specified, it is prompted for.
.SS "show"
.IX Subsection "show"
Synonym for \*(L"info\*(R".
.SS "uninstall"
.IX Subsection "uninstall"
Synonym for remove.
.SS "update [\fIoption\fP...] [\fIpkg\fP...]"
.IX Subsection "update [option...] [pkg...]"
Updates the packages given as arguments to the latest version available
at the installation source.  Either \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR or at least one \fIpkg\fR name
must be specified.  Options:
.IP "\fB\-\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "--all"
Update all installed packages except for \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR itself. If updates to
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR itself are present, this gives an error, unless also the option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-force\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-self\*(C'\fR is given. (See below.)
.Sp
In addition to updating the installed packages, during the update of a
collection the local installation is (by default) synchronized to the
status of the collection on the server, for both additions and removals.
.Sp
This means that if a package has been removed on the server (and thus
has also been removed from the respective collection), \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR will
remove the package in the local installation.  This is called
``auto\-remove'' and is announced as such when using the option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-list\*(C'\fR.  This auto-removal can be suppressed using the option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-auto\-remove\*(C'\fR (not recommended, see option description).
.Sp
Analogously, if a package has been added to a collection on the server
that is also installed locally, it will be added to the local
installation.  This is called ``auto\-install'' and is announced as such
when using the option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-list\*(C'\fR.  This auto-installation can be
suppressed using the option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-auto\-install\*(C'\fR (also not recommended).
.Sp
An exception to the collection dependency checks (including the
auto-installation of packages just mentioned) are those that have been
``forcibly removed'' by you, that is, you called \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr remove \-\-force\*(C'\fR
on them.  (See the \f(CW\*(C`remove\*(C'\fR action documentation.)  To reinstall any
such forcibly removed packages use \f(CW\*(C`\-\-reinstall\-forcibly\-removed\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
To reiterate: automatic removals and additions are entirely determined
by comparison of collections. Thus, if you manually install an
individual package \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR which is later removed from the server,
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR will not notice and will not remove it locally. (It has to be
this way, without major rearchitecture work, because the tlpdb does not
record the repository from which packages come from.)
.Sp
If you want to exclude some packages from the current update run (e.g.,
due to a slow link), see the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\*(C'\fR option below.
.IP "\fB\-\-self\fR" 4
.IX Item "--self"
Update \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR itself (that is, the infrastructure packages) if updates
to it are present. On Windows this includes updates to the private Perl
interpreter shipped inside TeX Live.
.Sp
If this option is given together with either \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR or a list of
packages, then \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR will be updated first and, if this update
succeeds, the new version will be restarted to complete the rest of the
updates.
.Sp
In short:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  tlmgr update \-\-self        # update infrastructure only
\&  tlmgr update \-\-self \-\-all  # update infrastructure and all packages
\&  tlmgr update \-\-force \-\-all # update all packages but *not* infrastructure
\&                             # ... this last at your own risk, not recommended!
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dry-run"
Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed are
written to the terminal.  This is a more detailed report than \f(CW\*(C`\-\-list\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-list\fR [\fIpkg\fR]" 4
.IX Item "--list [pkg]"
Concisely list the packages which would be updated, newly installed, or
removed, without actually changing anything. 
If \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR is also given, all available updates are listed.
If \f(CW\*(C`\-\-self\*(C'\fR is given, but not \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR, only updates to the
critical packages (tlmgr, texlive infrastructure, perl on Windows, etc.)
are listed.
If neither \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR nor \f(CW\*(C`\-\-self\*(C'\fR is given, and in addition no \fIpkg\fR is
given, then \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR is assumed (thus, \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr update \-\-list\*(C'\fR is the
same as \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr update \-\-list \-\-all\*(C'\fR).
If neither \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR nor \f(CW\*(C`\-\-self\*(C'\fR is given, but specific package names are
given, those packages are checked for updates.
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\fR \fIpkg\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude pkg"
Exclude \fIpkg\fR from the update process.  If this option is given more
than once, its arguments accumulate.
.Sp
An argument \fIpkg\fR excludes both the package \fIpkg\fR itself and all
its related platform-specific packages \fIpkg.ARCH\fR.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  tlmgr update \-\-all \-\-exclude a2ping
.Ve
.Sp
will not update \f(CW\*(C`a2ping\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a2ping.i386\-linux\*(C'\fR, or
any other \f(CW\*(C`a2ping.\*(C'\fR\fI\s-1ARCH\s0\fR package.
.Sp
If this option specifies a package that would otherwise be a candidate
for auto-installation, auto-removal, or reinstallation of a forcibly
removed package, \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR quits with an error message.  Excludes are not
supported in these circumstances.
.Sp
This option can also be set permanently in the tlmgr config file with 
the key \f(CW\*(C`update\-exclude\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-auto\-remove\fR [\fIpkg\fR...]" 4
.IX Item "--no-auto-remove [pkg...]"
By default, \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR tries to remove packages in an existing collection
which have disappeared on the server, as described above under \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR.
This option prevents such removals, either for all packages (with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR), or for just the given \fIpkg\fR names. This can lead to an
inconsistent TeX installation, since packages are not infrequently
renamed or replaced by their authors. Therefore this is not recommended.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-auto\-install\fR [\fIpkg\fR...]" 4
.IX Item "--no-auto-install [pkg...]"
Under normal circumstances \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR will install packages which are new
on the server, as described above under \f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR.  This option prevents
any such automatic installation, either for all packages (with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\*(C'\fR), or the given \fIpkg\fR names.
.Sp
Furthermore, after the \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR run using this has finished, the
packages that would have been auto-installed \fIwill be considered as
forcibly removed\fR.  So, if \f(CW\*(C`foobar\*(C'\fR is the only new package on the
server, then
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  tlmgr update \-\-all \-\-no\-auto\-install
.Ve
.Sp
is equivalent to
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  tlmgr update \-\-all
\&  tlmgr remove \-\-force foobar
.Ve
.Sp
Again, since packages are sometimes renamed or replaced, using this
option is not recommended.
.IP "\fB\-\-reinstall\-forcibly\-removed\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reinstall-forcibly-removed"
Under normal circumstances \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR will not install packages that have
been forcibly removed by the user; that is, removed with \f(CW\*(C`remove
\&\-\-force\*(C'\fR, or whose installation was prohibited by \f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-auto\-install\*(C'\fR
during an earlier update.
.Sp
This option makes \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR ignore the forcible removals and re-install
all such packages. This can be used to completely synchronize an
installation with the server's idea of what is available:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  tlmgr update \-\-reinstall\-forcibly\-removed \-\-all
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-backup\fR" 4
.IX Item "--backup"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-backupdir\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "--backupdir directory"
.PD
These two options control the creation of backups of packages \fIbefore\fR
updating; that is, backing up packages as currently installed.  If
neither option is given, no backup will made. If \f(CW\*(C`\-\-backupdir\*(C'\fR is
given and specifies a writable directory then a backup will be made in
that location. If only \f(CW\*(C`\-\-backup\*(C'\fR is given, then a backup will be made
to the directory previously set via the \*(L"option\*(R" action (see
below). If both are given then a backup will be made to the specified
\&\fIdirectory\fR.
.Sp
You can also set options via the \*(L"option\*(R" action to automatically make
backups for all packages, and/or keep only a certain number of backups.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR always makes a temporary backup when updating packages, in case
of download or other failure during an update.  In contrast, the purpose
of this \f(CW\*(C`\-\-backup\*(C'\fR option is to save a persistent backup in case the
actual \fIcontent\fR of the update causes problems, e.g., introduces an TeX
incompatibility.
.Sp
The \*(L"restore\*(R" action explains how to restore from a backup.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-depends\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-depends"
If you call for updating a package normally all depending packages
will also be checked for updates and updated if necessary. This switch
suppresses this behavior.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-depends\-at\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-depends-at-all"
See above under install (and beware).
.IP "\fB\-\-force\fR" 4
.IX Item "--force"
Force update of normal packages, without updating \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR itself 
(unless the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-self\*(C'\fR option is also given).  Not recommended.
.Sp
Also, \f(CW\*(C`update \-\-list\*(C'\fR is still performed regardless of this option.
.PP
If the package on the server is older than the package already installed
(e.g., if the selected mirror is out of date), \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR does not
downgrade.  Also, packages for uninstalled platforms are not installed.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR saves one copy of the main \f(CW\*(C`texlive.tlpdb\*(C'\fR file used for an
update with a suffix representing the repository url, as in
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.main.\*(C'\fR\fIlong-hash-string\fR. Thus, even when many
mirrors are used, only one main \f(CW\*(C`tlpdb\*(C'\fR backup is kept. For non-main
repositories, which do not generally have (m)any mirrors, no pruning of
backups is done.
.PP
This action does not automatically add or remove new symlinks in system
directories; you need to run \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR \*(L"path\*(R" yourself if you are using
this feature and want new symlinks added.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR reads two configuration files: one is system-wide, in

.PP
Finally, the \f(CW\*(C`no\-checksums\*(C'\fR key needs more explanation. By default,
package checksums computed and stored on the server (in the \s-1TLPDB\s0) are
compared to checksums computed locally after downloading.
\&\f(CW\*(C`no\-checksums\*(C'\fR disables this process. The checksum algorithm is
\&\s-1SHA\-512.\s0 Your system must have one of (looked for in this order) the
Perl \f(CW\*(C`Digest::SHA\*(C'\fR module, the \f(CW\*(C`openssl\*(C'\fR program
(<https://openssl.org>), the \f(CW\*(C`sha512sum\*(C'\fR program (from \s-1GNU\s0 Coreutils,
<https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils>), or finally the \f(CW\*(C`shasum\*(C'\fR
program (just to support old Macs). If none of these are available, a
warning is issued and \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR proceeds without checking checksums.
\&\f(CW\*(C`no\-checksums\*(C'\fR avoids the warning. (Incidentally, other \s-1SHA\s0
implementations, such as the pure Perl and pure Lua modules, are much
too slow to be usable in our context.)
.SH "CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION"
.IX Header "CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`install\-tl\*(C'\fR perform cryptographic verification if
possible.  If verification is performed and successful, the programs
report \f(CW\*(C`(verified)\*(C'\fR after loading the \s-1TLPDB\s0; otherwise, they report
\&\f(CW\*(C`(not verified)\*(C'\fR.  But either way, by default the installation and/or
updates proceed normally.
.PP
If a program named \f(CW\*(C`gpg\*(C'\fR is available (that is, found in \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR), by
default cryptographic signatures will be checked: we require the main
repository be signed, but not any additional repositories. If \f(CW\*(C`gpg\*(C'\fR is
not available, by default signatures are not checked and no verification
is carried out, but \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR still proceeds normally.
.PP
The behavior of the verification can be controlled by the command line
and config file option \f(CW\*(C`verify\-repo\*(C'\fR which takes one of the following
values: \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR. With \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, no verification
whatsoever is attempted.  With \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR (the default) verification is
required only for the main repository, and only if \f(CW\*(C`gpg\*(C'\fR is available;
though attempted for all, missing signatures of subsidiary repositories
will not result in an error.  Finally, in the case of \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`gpg\*(C'\fR
must be available and all repositories need to be signed.
.PP
In all cases, if a signature is checked and fails to verify, an error
is raised.
.PP
Cryptographic verification requires checksum checking (described just
above) to succeed, and a working GnuPG (\f(CW\*(C`gpg\*(C'\fR) program (see below for
search method).  Then, unless cryptographic verification has been
disabled, a signature file (\f(CW\*(C`texlive.tlpdb.*.asc\*(C'\fR) of the checksum file
is downloaded and the signature verified. The signature is created by
the TeX Live Distribution \s-1GPG\s0 key 0x0D5E5D9106BAB6BC, which in turn is
signed by Karl Berry's key 0x0716748A30D155AD and
Norbert Preining's key 0x6CACA448860CDC13.  All

Further adaptation of the \f(CW\*(C`gpg\*(C'\fR invocation can be made using the two

.SH "USER MODE"
.IX Header "USER MODE"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR provides a restricted way, called ``user mode'', to manage
arbitrary texmf trees in the same way as the main installation.  For
example, this allows people without write permissions on the
installation location to update/install packages into a tree of their
own.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR is switched into user mode with the command line option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-usermode\*(C'\fR.  It does not switch automatically, nor is there any
configuration file setting for it.  Thus, this option has to be
explicitly given every time user mode is to be activated.
.PP
This mode of \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR works on a user tree, by default the value of the

\&\f(CW\*(C`help\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`list\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`print\-platform\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`print\-platform\-info\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`search\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR.
.PP
On the other hand, most of the actions dealing with package management
do need write permissions, and thus behave differently in user mode, as
described below: \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`update\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`remove\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`option\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`paper\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`generate\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`backup\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`restore\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`uninstall\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`symlinks\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Before using \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR in user mode, you have to set up the user tree
with the \f(CW\*(C`init\-usertree\*(C'\fR action.  This creates \fIusertree\fR\f(CW\*(C`/web2c\*(C'\fR and
\&\fIusertree\fR\f(CW\*(C`/tlpkg/tlpobj\*(C'\fR, and a minimal
\&\fIusertree\fR\f(CW\*(C`/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb\*(C'\fR.  At that point, you can tell
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR to do the (supported) actions by adding the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-usermode\*(C'\fR
command line option.
.PP
In user mode the file \fIusertree\fR\f(CW\*(C`/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb\*(C'\fR contains only
the packages that have been installed into the user tree using \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR,
plus additional options from the ``virtual'' package
\&\f(CW\*(C`00texlive.installation\*(C'\fR (similar to the main installation's
\&\f(CW\*(C`texlive.tlpdb\*(C'\fR).
.PP
All actions on packages in user mode can only be carried out on packages
that are known as \f(CW\*(C`relocatable\*(C'\fR.  This excludes all packages containing
executables and a few other core packages.  Of the 2500 or so packages
currently in TeX Live the vast majority are relocatable and can be
installed into a user tree.
.PP
Description of changes of actions in user mode:
.SS "User mode install"
.IX Subsection "User mode install"
In user mode, the \f(CW\*(C`install\*(C'\fR action checks that the package and all
dependencies are all either relocated or already installed in the system
installation.  If this is the case, it unpacks all containers to be
installed into the user tree (to repeat, that's either \f(CW\*(C`TEXMFHOME\*(C'\fR or
the value of \f(CW\*(C`\-\-usertree\*(C'\fR) and add the respective packages to the user
tree's \f(CW\*(C`texlive.tlpdb\*(C'\fR (creating it if need be).
.PP
Currently installing a collection in user mode installs all dependent
packages, but in contrast to normal mode, does \fInot\fR install dependent
collections.  For example, in normal mode \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr install
collection\-context\*(C'\fR would install \f(CW\*(C`collection\-basic\*(C'\fR and other
collections, while in user mode, \fIonly\fR the packages mentioned in
\&\f(CW\*(C`collection\-context\*(C'\fR are installed.
.PP
If a package shipping map files is installed in user mode, a backup of
the user's \f(CW\*(C`updmap.cfg\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`USERTREE/web2c/\*(C'\fR is made, and then this file
regenerated from the list of installed packages.
.SS "User mode backup, restore, remove, update"
.IX Subsection "User mode backup, restore, remove, update"
In user mode, these actions check that all packages to be acted on are
installed in the user tree before proceeding; otherwise, they behave
just as in normal mode.
.SS "User mode generate, option, paper"
.IX Subsection "User mode generate, option, paper"
In user mode, these actions operate only on the user tree's
configuration files and/or \f(CW\*(C`texlive.tlpdb\*(C'\fR.
.SH "MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES"
.IX Header "MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES"
The main TeX Live repository contains a vast array of packages.
Nevertheless, additional local repositories can be useful to provide
locally-installed resources, such as proprietary fonts and house styles.
Also, alternative package repositories distribute packages that cannot
or should not be included in TeX Live, for whatever reason.
.PP
The simplest and most reliable method is to temporarily set the
installation source to any repository (with the \f(CW\*(C`\-repository\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`option repository\*(C'\fR command line options), and perform your operations.
.PP
When you are using multiple repositories over a sustained length of
time, however, explicitly switching between them becomes inconvenient.
Thus, it's possible to tell \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR about additional repositories you
want to use.  The basic command is \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr repository add\*(C'\fR.  The rest of
this section explains further.
.PP
When using multiple repositories, one of them has to be set as the main
repository, which distributes most of the installed packages.  When you
switch from a single repository installation to a multiple repository
installation, the previous sole repository will be set as the main
repository.
.PP
By default, even if multiple repositories are configured, packages are
\&\fIstill\fR \fIonly\fR installed from the main repository.  Thus, simply
adding a second repository does not actually enable installation of
anything from there.  You also have to specify which packages should be
taken from the new repository, by specifying so-called ``pinning''
rules, described next.
.SS "Pinning"
.IX Subsection "Pinning"
When a package \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR is pinned to a repository, a package \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR in any
other repository, even if it has a higher revision number, will not be
considered an installable candidate.
.PP
As mentioned above, by default everything is pinned to the main
repository.  Let's now go through an example of setting up a second
repository and enabling updates of a package from it.
.PP
First, check that we have support for multiple repositories, and have
only one enabled (as is the case by default):
.PP
.Vb 3
\& $ tlmgr repository list
\& List of repositories (with tags if set):
\&   /var/www/norbert/tlnet
.Ve
.PP
Ok.  Let's add the \f(CW\*(C`tlcontrib\*(C'\fR repository (this is a real
repository hosted at <http://contrib.texlive.info>) with the tag \f(CW\*(C`tlcontrib\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ tlmgr repository add http://contrib.texlive.info/current tlcontrib
.Ve
.PP
Check the repository list again:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& $ tlmgr repository list
\& List of repositories (with tags if set):
\&    http://contrib.texlive.info/current (tlcontrib)
\&    /var/www/norbert/tlnet (main)
.Ve
.PP
Now we specify a pinning entry to get the package \f(CW\*(C`classico\*(C'\fR from
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlcontrib\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ tlmgr pinning add tlcontrib classico
.Ve
.PP
Check that we can find \f(CW\*(C`classico\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& $ tlmgr show classico
\& package:     classico
\& ...
\& shortdesc:   URW Classico fonts
\& ...
.Ve
.PP
\&\- install \f(CW\*(C`classico\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& $ tlmgr install classico
\& tlmgr: package repositories:
\& ...
\& [1/1,  ??:??/??:??] install: classico @tlcontrib [737k]
.Ve
.PP
In the output here you can see that the \f(CW\*(C`classico\*(C'\fR package has been
installed from the \f(CW\*(C`tlcontrib\*(C'\fR repository (\f(CW@tlcontrib\fR).
.PP
Finally, \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr pinning\*(C'\fR also supports removing certain or all packages
from a given repository:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $ tlmgr pinning remove tlcontrib classico # remove just classico
\&  $ tlmgr pinning remove tlcontrib \-\-all    # take nothing from tlcontrib
.Ve
.PP
A summary of \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr pinning\*(C'\fR actions is given above.
.SH "GUI FOR TLMGR"
.IX Header "GUI FOR TLMGR"
The graphical user interface for \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR requires Perl/Tk
<https://search.cpan.org/search?query=perl%2Ftk>. For Unix-based
systems Perl/Tk (as well as Perl of course) has to be installed
outside of \s-1TL.\s0  <https://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk> has a
list of invocations for some distros.  For Windows the necessary
modules are no longer shipped within TeX Live, so you'll have to have an
external Perl available that includes them.
.PP
We are talking here about the \s-1GUI\s0 built into tlmgr itself, not about the
other tlmgr GUIs, which are: tlshell (Tcl/Tk\-based), tlcockpit
(Java-based) and, only on Macs, TeX Live Utility. These are invoked as
separate programs.
.PP
The \s-1GUI\s0 mode of tlmgr is started with the invocation \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr gui\*(C'\fR;
assuming Tk is loadable, the graphical user interface will be shown.
The main window contains a menu bar, the main display, and a status
area where messages normally shown on the console are displayed.
.PP
Within the main display there are three main parts: the \f(CW\*(C`Display
configuration\*(C'\fR area, the list of packages, and the action buttons.
.PP
Also, at the top right the currently loaded repository is shown; this
also acts as a button and when clicked will try to load the default
repository.  To load a different repository, see the \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR menu item.
.PP
Finally, the status area at the bottom of the window gives additional
information about what is going on.
.SS "Main display"
.IX Subsection "Main display"
\fIDisplay configuration area\fR
.IX Subsection "Display configuration area"
.PP
The first part of the main display allows you to specify (filter) which
packages are shown.  By default, all are shown.  Changes here are
reflected right away.
.IP "Status" 4
.IX Item "Status"
Select whether to show all packages (the default), only those installed,
only those \fInot\fR installed, or only those with update available.
.IP "Category" 4
.IX Item "Category"
Select which categories are shown: packages, collections, and/or
schemes.  These are briefly explained in the \*(L"\s-1DESCRIPTION\*(R"\s0 section
above.
.IP "Match" 4
.IX Item "Match"
Select packages matching for a specific pattern.  By default, this
searches both descriptions and filenames.  You can also select a subset
for searching.
.IP "Selection" 4
.IX Item "Selection"
Select packages to those selected, those not selected, or all.  Here,
``selected'' means that the checkbox in the beginning of the line of a
package is ticked.
.IP "Display configuration buttons" 4
.IX Item "Display configuration buttons"
To the right there are three buttons: select all packages, select none
(a.k.a. deselect all), and reset all these filters to the defaults,
i.e., show all available.
.PP
\fIPackage list area\fR
.IX Subsection "Package list area"
.PP
The second are of the main display lists all installed packages.  If a
repository is loaded, those that are available but not installed are
also listed.
.PP
Double clicking on a package line pops up an informational window with
further details: the long description, included files, etc.
.PP
Each line of the package list consists of the following items:
.IP "a checkbox" 4
.IX Item "a checkbox"
Used to select particular packages; some of the action buttons (see
below) work only on the selected packages.
.IP "package name" 4
.IX Item "package name"
The name (identifier) of the package as given in the database.
.IP "local revision (and version)" 4
.IX Item "local revision (and version)"
If the package is installed the TeX Live revision number for the
installed package will be shown.  If there is a catalogue version given
in the database for this package, it will be shown in parentheses.
However, the catalogue version, unlike the \s-1TL\s0 revision, is not
guaranteed to reflect what is actually installed.
.IP "remote revision (and version)" 4
.IX Item "remote revision (and version)"
If a repository has been loaded the revision of the package in the
repository (if present) is shown.  As with the local column, if a
catalogue version is provided it will be displayed.  And also as with
the local column, the catalogue version may be stale.
.IP "short description" 4
.IX Item "short description"
The short description of the package.
.PP
\fIMain display action buttons\fR
.IX Subsection "Main display action buttons"
.PP
Below the list of packages are several buttons:
.IP "Update all installed" 4
.IX Item "Update all installed"
This calls \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr update \-\-all\*(C'\fR, i.e., tries to update all available
packages.  Below this button is a toggle to allow reinstallation of
previously removed packages as part of this action.
.Sp
The other four buttons only work on the selected packages, i.e., those
where the checkbox at the beginning of the package line is ticked.
.IP "Update" 4
.IX Item "Update"
Update only the selected packages.
.IP "Install" 4
.IX Item "Install"
Install the selected packages; acts like \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr install\*(C'\fR, i.e., also
installs dependencies.  Thus, installing a collection installs all its
constituent packages.
.IP "Remove" 4
.IX Item "Remove"
Removes the selected packages; acts like \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr remove\*(C'\fR, i.e., it will
also remove dependencies of collections (but not dependencies of normal
packages).
.IP "Backup" 4
.IX Item "Backup"
Makes a backup of the selected packages; acts like \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr backup\*(C'\fR. This
action needs the option \f(CW\*(C`backupdir\*(C'\fR set (see \f(CW\*(C`Options \-\*(C'\fR General>).
.SS "Menu bar"
.IX Subsection "Menu bar"
The following entries can be found in the menu bar:
.ie n .IP """tlmgr"" menu" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtlmgr\fR menu" 4
.IX Item "tlmgr menu"
The items here load various repositories: the default as specified in
the TeX Live database, the default network repository, the repository
specified on the command line (if any), and an arbitrarily
manually-entered one.  Also has the so-necessary \f(CW\*(C`quit\*(C'\fR operation.
.ie n .IP """Options menu""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWOptions menu\fR" 4
.IX Item "Options menu"
Provides access to several groups of options: \f(CW\*(C`Paper\*(C'\fR (configuration of
default paper sizes), \f(CW\*(C`Platforms\*(C'\fR (only on Unix, configuration of the
supported/installed platforms), \f(CW\*(C`GUI Language\*(C'\fR (select language used in
the \s-1GUI\s0 interface), and \f(CW\*(C`General\*(C'\fR (everything else).
.Sp
Several toggles are also here.  The first is \f(CW\*(C`Expert options\*(C'\fR, which is
set by default.  If you turn this off, the next time you start the \s-1GUI\s0 a
simplified screen will be shown that display only the most important
functionality.  This setting is saved in the configuration file of
\&\f(CW\*(C`tlmgr\*(C'\fR; see \*(L"\s-1CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR\*(R"\s0 for details.
.Sp
The other toggles are all off by default: for debugging output, to
disable the automatic installation of new packages, and to disable the
automatic removal of packages deleted from the server.  Playing with the
choices of what is or isn't installed may lead to an inconsistent TeX Live
installation; e.g., when a package is renamed.
.ie n .IP """Actions menu""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWActions menu\fR" 4
.IX Item "Actions menu"
Provides access to several actions: update the filename database (aka
\&\f(CW\*(C`ls\-R\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`mktexlsr\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`texhash\*(C'\fR), rebuild all formats (\f(CW\*(C`fmtutil\-sys
\&\-\-all\*(C'\fR), update the font map database (\f(CW\*(C`updmap\-sys\*(C'\fR), restore from a backup
of a package, and use of symbolic links in system directories (not on
Windows).
.Sp
The final action is to remove the entire TeX Live installation (also not
on Windows).
.ie n .IP """Help menu""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWHelp menu\fR" 4
.IX Item "Help menu"
Provides access to the TeX Live manual (also on the web at
<https://tug.org/texlive/doc.html>) and the usual ``About'' box.
.SS "\s-1GUI\s0 options"
.IX Subsection "GUI options"
Some generic Perl/Tk options can be specified with \f(CW\*(C`tlmgr gui\*(C'\fR to
control the display:
.ie n .IP """\-background"" \fIcolor\fR" 4

.RS 4
.IP "1." 8
If the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`TEXLIVE_DOWNLOADER\*(C'\fR is defined, use it;
abort if the specified program doesn't work. Possible values: \f(CW\*(C`lwp\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`curl\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`wget\*(C'\fR. The necessary options are added internally.
.IP "2." 8
If the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`TL_DOWNLOAD_PROGRAM\*(C'\fR is
defined (can be any value), use it together with
\&\f(CW\*(C`TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS\*(C'\fR; abort if it doesn't work.
.IP "3." 8
If \s-1LWP\s0 is available and working, use that (by far the most
efficient method, as it supports persistent downloads).
.IP "4." 8
If curl is available (from the system) and working, use that.
.IP "5." 8
If wget is available (either from the system or \s-1TL\s0) and working, use that.

\&\s-1TL\s0 provides \f(CW\*(C`wget\*(C'\fR binaries for platforms where necessary, so some
download method should always be available.

.IX Item "TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN"
By default, compression and download programs provided by the system,
i.e., found along \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR are preferred over those shipped with TeX
Live.
.Sp
This can create problems with systems that are too old, and so can be
overridden by setting the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN\*(C'\fR to
1. In this case, executables shipped with \s-1TL\s0 will be preferred.
.Sp
Extra compression/download programs not provided by \s-1TL,\s0 such as gzip,
lwp, and curl, are still checked for on the system and used if
available, per the above. \f(CW\*(C`TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN\*(C'\fR only applies when the
program being checked for is shipped with \s-1TL,\s0 namely the lz4 and
xz compressors and wget downloader.
.Sp
Exception: on Windows, the \f(CW\*(C`tar.exe\*(C'\fR shipped with \s-1TL\s0 is always used,
regardless of any setting.
