This is the file CJKnumb.txt of the CJK macro package ver. 4.8.5

CJKnumb.sty
------------

This package provides commands to typeset CJK representations of
numbers (within a CJK or CJK* environment).

  \CJKnumber{number}
    Convert `number' to a full CJK representation.

  \CJKdigits{arg}
  \CJKdigits*{arg}
    Handle `arg' as a string of digits and convert each of them into the
    corresponding CJK digit. The starred version uses the traditional glyph
    for digit zero; the unstarred version uses the CJK circle glyph.

Usage:

  \usepackage{CJK}
  \usepackage{CJKnumb}
