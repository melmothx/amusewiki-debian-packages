Description: Poppins fonts
 Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design
 tool ever since these actors took to the worldâ€™s stage.
 Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition.
 With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems,
 it is an internationalist take on the genre.
 .
 Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more
 constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari
 design is particularly new, and is the first ever Devanagari
 typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like
 the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry,
 particularly circles.
 .
 Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical
 corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to
 maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base
 character height and the Latin ascender height are equal;
 Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari
 characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high.
 .
 The Devanagari is designed by Ninad Kale. The Latin is by
 Jonny Pinhorn. To contribute, see
