Description: Super-lightweight exception framework
 This stripped-down exception framework provides a baseline of
 functionality for distributions that want to expose exception
 hierarchies with minimal fuss. It’s a pattern that I implemented in
 some other distributions I created and didn’t want to copy/paste
 around.
