Description: AlegreyaSans fonts
 Alegreya Sans is a humanist sans serif family with a
 calligraphic feeling that conveys a dynamic and varied
 rhythm. This gives a pleasant feeling to readers of long
 texts. There is also a Small Caps companion family.
 .
 The Alegreya type system is a "super family", originally
 intended for literature, and includes sans and serif sister
 families. The family follows humanist proportions and
 principles, and achieves a ludic and harmonious paragraph
 through elements carefully designed in an atmosphere of
 diversity. The italics bring a strong emphasis to the roman
 styles.
